"" (CA-G.R. No. CV No. 17962).
[1]
The facts of the case are as follows:
The Province of Tarlac maintains a current account with the Philippine National Bank (PNB) Tarlac Branch where the provincial funds are deposited. Checks issued by the Province are signed by the Provincial Treasurer and countersigned by the Provincial Auditor or the Secretary of the Sangguniang Bayan.
A portion of the funds of the province is allocated to the Concepcion Emergency Hospital.
[2]
The allotment checks for said government hospital are drawn to the order of ""Concepcion. Emergency Hospital, Concepcion, Tarlac"" or ""The Chief, Concepcion Emergency Hospital, Concepcion, Tarlac."" The checks are released by the Office of the Provincial Treasurer and received for the hospital by its administrative officer and cashier.
In January 1981, the books of account of the Provincial Treasurer were post-audited by the Provincial Auditor. It was then discovered that the hospital did not receive several allotment checks drawn by the Province.
On February 19, 1981, the Provincial Treasurer requested the manager of the PNB to return all of its cleared checks which were issued from 1977 to 1980 in order to verify the regularity of their encashment. After the checks were examined, the Provincial Treasurer learned that 30 checks amounting to P203,300.00 were encashed by one Fausto Pangilinan, with the Associated Bank acting as collecting bank.
It turned out that Fausto Pangilinan, who was the administrative officer and cashier of payee hospital until his retirement on February 28, 1978, collected the questioned checks from the office of the Provincial Treasurer. He claimed to be assisting or helping the hospital follow up the release of the checks and had official receipts.
[3]
Pangilinan sought to encash the first check
[4]
with Associated Bank. However, the manager of Associated Bank refused and suggested that Pangilinan deposit the check in his personal savings account with the same bank. Pangilinan was able to withdraw the money when the check was cleared and paid by the drawee bank, PNB.
After forging the signature of Dr. Adena Canlas who was chief of the payee hospital, Pangilinan followed the same procedure for the second check, in the amount of P5,000.00 and dated April 20, 1978,
[5]
as well as for twenty-eight other checks, of various amounts and on various dates. The last check negotiated by Pangilinan was for P8,000.00 and dated February 10, 1981.
[6]
All the checks bore the stamp of Associated Bank which reads ""All prior endorsements guaranteed ASSOCIATED BANK.""
Jesus David, the manager of Associated Bank testified that Pangilinan made it appear that the checks were paid to him for certain projects with the hospital.
[7]
He did not find as irregular the fact that the checks were not payable to Pangilinan but to the Concepcion Emergency Hospital. While he admitted that his wife and Pangilinanâs wife are first cousins, the manager denied having given Pangilinan preferential treatment on this account.
[8]
On February 26, 1981, the Provincial Treasurer wrote the manager of the PNB seeking the restoration of the various amounts debited from the current account of the Province.
[9]
In turn, the PNB manager demanded reimbursement from the Associated Bank on May 15, 1981.
[10]
As both banks resisted payment, the Province of Tarlac brought suit against PNB which, in turn, impleaded Associated Bank as third-party defendant. The latter then filed a fourth-party complaint against Adena Canlas and Fausto Pangilinan.
[11]
After trial on the merits, the lower court rendered its decision on March 21, 1988, disposing as follows:
""WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered:
1. On the basic complaint, in favor of plaintiff Province of Tarlac and against defendant Philippine National Bank (PNB), ordering the latter to pay to the former, the sum of Two Hundred Three Thousand Three Hundred (P203,300.00) Pesos with legal interest thereon from March 20, 1981 until fully paid;
2. On the third-party complaint, in favor of defendant/third-party plaintiff Philippine National Bank (PNB) and against third-party defendant/fourth-party plaintiff Associated Bank ordering the latter to reimburse to the former the amount of Two Hundred Three Thousand Three Hundred (P203,300.00) Pesos with legal interests thereon from March 20, 1981 until fully paid;.
3. On the fourth-party complaint, the same is hereby ordered dismissed for lack of cause of action as against fourth-party defendant Adena Canlas and lack of jurisdiction over the person of fourth-party defendant Fausto Pangilinan as against the latter.
4. On the counterclaims on the complaint, third-party complaint and fourth-party complaint, the same are hereby ordered dismissed for lack of merit.
SO ORDERED.
[12]
PNB and Associated Bank appealed to the Court of AppealS.
[13]
Respondent court affirmed the trial courtâs decision in toto on September 30, 1992.
Hence these consolidated petitions which seek a reversal of respondent appellate courtâs decision.
PNB assigned two errors. First, the bank contends that respondent court erred in exempting the Province of Tarlac from liability when, in fact, the latter was negligent because it delivered and released the questioned checks to Fausto Pangilinan who was then already retired as the hospitalâs cashier and administrative officer. PNB also maintains its innocence and alleges that as between two innocent persons, the one whose act was the cause of the loss, in this case the Province of Tarlac, bears the loss.
Next, PNB asserts that it was error for the court to order it to pay the province and then seek reimbursement from Associated Bank. According to petitioner bank, respondent appellate Court should have directed Associated Bank to pay the adjudged liability directly to the Province of Tarlac to avoid circuity.
[14]
Associated Bank, on the other hand, argues that the order of liability should be totally reversed, with the drawee bank (PNB) solely and ultimately bearing the loss.
Respondent court allegedly erred in applying Section 23 of the Philippine Clearing House Rules instead of Central Bank Circular No. 580, which, being an administrative regulation issued pursuant to law, has the force and effect of law.
[15]
The PCHC Rules are merely contractual stipulations among and between member-banks. As such, they cannot prevail over the aforesaid CB Circular.
It likewise contends that PNB, the drawee bank, is estopped from asserting the defense of guarantee of prior indorsements against Associated Bank, the collecting bank. In stamping the guarantee (for all prior indorsements), it merely followed a mandatory requirement for clearing and had no choice but to place the stamp of guarantee; otherwise, there would be no clearing. The bank will be in a ""no-win"" situation and will always bear the loss as against the drawee bank.
[16]
Associated Bank also claims that since PNB already cleared and paid the value of the forged checks in question, it is now estopped from asserting the defense that Associated Bank guaranteed prior indorsements. The drawee bank allegedly has the primary duty to verify the genuineness of payeeâs indorsement before paying the check.
[17]
While both banks are innocent of the forgery, Associated Bank claims that PNB was at fault and should solely bear the loss because it cleared and paid the forged checks.
xxx
The case at bench concerns checks payable to the order of Concepcion Emergency Hospital or its Chief. They were properly issued and bear the genuine signatures of the drawer, the Province of Tarlac. The infirmity in the questioned checks lies in the payeeâs (Concepcion Emergency Hospital) indorsements which are forgeries. At the time of their indorsement, the checks were order instruments.
Checks having forged indorsements should be differentiated from forged checks or checks bearing the forged signature of the drawer.
Section 23 of the Negotiable Instruments Law (NIL) provides:
Sec. 23. FORGED SIGNATURE, EFFECT OF. - When a signature is forged or made without authority of the person whose signature it purports to be, it is wholly inoperative, and no right to retain the instrument, or to give a discharge therefor, or to enforce payment thereof against any party thereto, can be acquired through or under such signature unless the party against whom it is sought to enforce such right is precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority.
A forged signature, whether it be that of the drawer or the payee, is wholly inoperative and no one can gain title to the instrument through it. A person whose signature to an instrument was forged was never a party and never consented to the contract which allegedly gave rise to such instrument.
[18]
Section 23 does not avoid the instrument but only the forged signature.
[19]
Thus, a forged indorsement does not operate as the payeeâs indorsement.
The exception to the general rule in Section 23 is where ""a party against whom it is sought to enforce a right is precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority. ""Parties who warrant or admit the genuineness of the signature in question and those who, by their acts, silence or negligence are estopped from setting up the defense of forgery, are precluded from using this defense. Indorsers, persons negotiating by delivery and acceptors are warrantors of the genuineness of the signatures on the instIument.
[20]
In bearer instruments, the signature of the payee or holder is unnecessary to pass title to the instrument. Hence, when the indorsement is a forgery, only the person whose signature is forged can raise the defense of forgery against a holder in due course.
[21]
The checks involved in this case are order instruments, hence, the following discussion is made with reference to the effects of a forged indorsement on an instrument payable to order.
Where the instrument is payable to order at the time of the forgery, such as the checks in this case, the signature of its rightful holder (here, the payee hospital) is essential to transfer title to the same instrument. When the holderâs indorsement is forged, all parties prior to the forgery may raise the real defense of forgery against all parties subsequent thereto.
[22]
An indorser of an order instrument warrants ""that the instrument is genuine and in all respects what it purports to be; that he has a good title to it; that all prior parties had capacity to contract; and that the instrument is at the time of his indorsement valid and subsisting.""
[23]
He cannot interpose the defense that signatures prior to him are forged.
A collecting bank where a check is deposited and which indorses the check upon presentment with the drawee bank, is such an indorser. So even if the indorsement on the check deposited by the banksâs client is forged, the collecting bank is bound by his warranties as an indorser and cannot set up the defense of forgery as against the drawee bank.
The bank on which a check is drawn, known as the drawee bank, is under strict liability to pay the check to the order of the payee. The drawerâs instructions are reflected on the face and by the terms of the check. Payment under a forged indorsement is not to the drawerâs order. When the drawee bank pays a person other than the payee, it does not comply with the terms of the check and violates its duty to charge its customerâs (the drawer) account only for properly payable items. Since the drawee bank did not pay a holder or other person entitled to receive payment, it has no right to reimbursement from the drawer.24 The general rule then is that the drawee bank may not debit the drawerâs account and is not entitled to indemnification from the drawer.
[25]
The risk of loss must perforce fall on the drawee bank.
However, if the drawee bank can prove a failure by the customer/drawer to exercise ordinary care that substantially contributed to the making of the forged signature, the drawer is precluded from asserting the forgery.
If at the same time the drawee bank was also negligent to the point of substantially contributing to the loss, then such loss from the forgery can be apportioned between the negligent drawer and the negligent bank.
[26]
In cases involving a forged check, where the drawerâs signature is forged, the drawer can recover from the drawee bank. No drawee bank has a right to pay a forged check. If it does, it shall have to recredit the amount of the check to the account of the drawer. The liability chain ends with the drawee bank whose responsibility it is to know the drawerâs signature since the latter is its customer.
[27]
In cases involving checks with forged indorsements, such as the present petition, the chain of liability does not end with the drawee bank. The drawee bank may not debit the account of the drawer but may generally pass liability back through the collection chain to the party who took from the forger and, of course, to the forger himself, if available.
[28]
In other words, the drawee bank can seek reimbursement or a return of the amount it paid from the presentor bank or person.
[29]
Theoretically, the latter can demand reimbursement from the person who indorsed the check to it and so on. The loss falls on the party who took the check from the forger, or on the forger himself.
In this case, the checks were indorsed by the collecting bank (Associated Bank) to the drawee bank (PNB). The former will necessarily be liable to the latter for the checks bearing forged indorsements. If the forgery is that of the payeeâs or holderâs indorsement, the collecting bank is held liable, without prejudice to the latter proceeding against the forger.
Since a forged indorsement is inoperative, the collecting bank had no right to be paid by the drawee bank. The former must necessarily return the money paid by the latter because it was paid wrongfully.
[30]
More importantly, by reason of the statutory warranty of a general indorser in Section 66 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, a collecting bank which indorses a check bearing a forged indorsement and presents it to the drawee bank guarantees all prior indorsements, including the forged indorsement. It warrants that the instrument is genuine, and that it is valid and subsisting at the time of his indorsement. Because the indorsement is a forgery, the collecting bank commits a breach of this warranty and will be accountable to the drawee bank. This liability scheme operates without regard to fault on the part of the collecting/presenting bank. Even if the latter bank was not negligent, it would still be liable to the drawee bank because of its indorsement.
The Court has consistently ruled that ""the collecting bank or last endorser generally suffers the loss because it has the duty to ascertain the genuineness of all prior endorsements considering that the act of presenting the check for payment to the drawee is an assertion that the party making the presentment has done its duty to ascertain the genuineness of the endorsements.""
[31]
The drawee bank is not similarly situated as the collecting bank because the former makes no warranty as to the genuineness of any indorsement.
[32]
The drawee bankâs duty is but to verify the genuineness of the drawerâs signature and not of the indorsement because the drawer is its client.
Moreover, the collecting bank is made liable because it is privy to the depositor who negotiated the check. The bank knows him, his address and history because he is a client. It has taken a risk on his deposit. The bank is also in a better position to detect forgery, fraud or irregularity in the indorsement.
Hence, the drawee bank can recover the amount paid on the check bearing a forged indorsement from the collecting bank. However, a drawee bank has the duty to promptly inform the presentor of the forgery upon discovery. If the drawee bank delays in informing the presentor of the forgery, thereby depriving said presentor of the right to recover from the forger, the former is deemed negligent and can no longer recover from the presentor.
[33]
Applying these rules to the case at bench, PNB, the drawee bank, cannot debit the current account of the Province of Tarlac because it paid checks which bore forged indorsements. However, if the Province of Tarlac as drawer was negligent to the point of substantially contributing to the loss, then the drawee bank PNB can charge its account. If both drawee bank-PNB and drawer-Province of Tarlac were negligent, the loss should be properly apportioned between them.
The loss incurred by drawee bank-PNB can be passed on to the collecting bank-Associated Bank which presented and indorsed the checks to it. Associated Bank can, in turn, hold the forger, Fausto Pangilinan, liable.
If PNB negligently delayed in informing Associated Bank of the forgery, thus depriving the latter of the opportunity to recover from the forger, it forfeits its right to reimbursement and will be made to bear the loss.
After careful examination of the records, the Court finds that the Province of Tarlac was equally negligent and should, therefore, share the burden of loss from the checks bearing a forged indorsement.
The Province of Tarlac permitted Fausto Pangilinan to collect the checks when the latter, having already retired from government service, was no longer connected with the hospital. With the exception of the first check (dated January 17, 1978), all the checks were issued and released after Pangilinanâs retirement on February 28, 1978. After nearly three years, the Treasurerâs office was still releasing the checks to the retired cashier. In addition, some of the aid allotment checks were released to Pangilinan and the others to Elizabeth Juco, the new cashier. The fact that there were now two persons collecting the checks for the hospital is an unmistakable sign of an irregularity which should have alerted employees in the Treasurerâs office of the fraud being committed. There is also evidence indicating that the provincial employees were aware of Pangilinanâs retirement and consequent dissociation from the hospital. Jose Meru, the Provincial Treasurer, testified:.
""ATTY. MORGA:
Q :  Now, is it true that for a given month there were two releases of checks, one went to Mr. Pangilinan and one went to Miss Juco?
JOSE MERU:
A :   Yes, sir.
Q :  Will you please tell us how at the time (sic) when the authorized representative of Concepcion Emergency Hospital is and was supposed to be Miss Juco?
A :   Well, as far as my investigation show (sic) the assistant cashier told me that Pangilinan represented himself as also authorized to help in the release of these checks and we were apparently misled because they accepted the representation of Pangilinan that he was helping them in the release of the checks and besides according to them they were, Pangilinan, like the rest, was able to present an official receipt to acknowledge these receipts and according to them since this is a government check and believed that it will eventually go to the hospital following the standard procedure of negotiating government checks, they released the checks to Pangilinan aside from Miss Juco.""
[34]
The failure of the Province of Tarlac to exercise due care contributed to a significant degree to the loss tantamount to negligence. Hence, the Province of Tarlac should be liable for part of the total amount paid on the questioned checks.
The drawee bank PNB also breached its duty to pay only according to the terms of the check. Hence, it cannot escape liability and should also bear part of the loss.
As earlier stated, PNB can recover from the collecting bank.
In the case of
Associated Bank
v.
CA,
[35]
six crossed checks with forged indorsements were deposited in the forgerâs account with the collecting bank and were later paid by four different drawee banks. The Court found the collecting bank (Associated) to be negligent and held:
""The Bank should have first verified his right to endorse the crossed checks, of which he was not the payee, and to deposit the proceeds of the checks to his own account. The Bank was by reason of the nature of the checks put upon notice that they were issued for deposit only to the private respondentâs account. xxx""
The situation in the case at bench is analogous to the above case, for it was not the payee who deposited the checks with the collecting bank. Here, the checks were all payable to Concepcion Emergency Hospital but it was Fausto Pangilinan who deposited the checks in his personal savings account.
Although Associated Bank claims that the guarantee stamped on the checks (All prior and/or lack of endorsements guaranteed) is merely a requirement forced upon it by clearing house rules, it cannot but remain liable. The stamp guaranteeing prior indorsements is not an empty rubric which a bank must fulfill for the sake of convenience. A bank is not required to accept all the checks negotiated to it. It is within the bahkâs discretion to receive a check for no banking institution would consciously or deliberately accept a check bearing a forged indorsement. When a check is deposited with the collecting bank, it takes a risk on its depositor. It is only logical that this bank be held accountable for checks deposited by its customers.
A delay in informing the collecting bank (Associated Bank) of the forgery, which deprives it of the opportunity to go after the forger, signifies negligence on the part of the drawee bank (PNB) and will preclude it from claiming reimbursement.
It is here that Associated Bankâs assignment of error concerning C.B. Circular No. 580 and Section 23 of the Philippine Clearing House Corporation Rules comes to fore. Under Section 4(c) of CB Circular No. 580, items bearing a forged endorsement shall be returned within twenty-four (24) hours after discovery of the forgery but in no event beyond the period fixed or provided by law for filing of a legal action by the returning bank. Section 23 of the PCHC Rules deleted the requirement that items bearing a forged endorsement should be returned within twenty-four hours. Associated Bank now argues that the aforementioned Central Bank Circular is applicable. Since PNB did not return the questioned checks within twenty-four hours, but several days later, Associated Bank alleges that PNB should be considered negligent and not entitled to reimbursement of the amount it paid on the checks.
The Court deems it unnecessary to discuss Associated Bankâs assertions that CB Circular No. 580 is an administrative regulation issued pursuant to law and as such, must prevail over the PCHC rule. The Central Bank circular was in force for all banks until June 1980 when the Philippine Clearing House Corporation (PCHC) was set up and commenced operations. Banks in Metro Manila were covered by the PCHC while banks located elsewhere still had to go through Central Bank Clearing. In any event, the twenty-four-hour return rule was adopted by the PCHC until it was changed in 1982. The contending banks herein, which are both branches in Tarlac province, are therefore not covered by PCHC Rules but by CB Circular No. 580. Clearly then, the CB circular was applicable when the forgery of the checks was discovered in 1981.
The rule mandates that the checks be returned within twenty-four hours after discovery of the forgery but in no event beyond the period fixed by law for filing a legal action. The rationale of the rule is to give the collecting bank (which indorsed the check) adequate opportunity to proceed against the forger. If prompt notice is not given, the collecting bank maybe prejudiced and lose the opportunity to go after its depositor.
The Court finds that even if PNB did not return the questioned checks to Associated Bank within twenty-four hours, as mandated by the rule, PNB did not commit negligent delay. Under the circumstances, PNB gave prompt notice to Associated Bank and the latter bank was not prejudiced in going after Fausto Pangilinan. After the Province of Tarlac informed PNB of the forgeries, PNB necessarily had to inspect the checks and conduct its own investigation. Thereafter, it requested the Provincial Treasurerâs office on March 31, 1981 to return the checks for verification. The Province of Tarlac returned the checks only on April 22, 1981. Two days later, Associated Bank received the checks from PNB.
[36]
Associated Bank was also furnished a copy of the Provinceâs letter of demand to PNB dated March 20, 1981, thus giving it notice of the forgeries. At this time, however, Pangilinanâs account with Associated had only P24.63 in it.
[37]
Had Associated Bank decided to debit Pangilinanâs account, it could not have recovered the amounts paid on the questioned checks. In addition, while Associated Bank filed a fourth-party complaint against Fausto Pangilinan, it did not present evidence against Pangilinan and even presented him as its rebuttal witness.
[38]
Hence, Associated Bank was not prejudiced by PNBâs failure to comply with the twenty-four-hour return rule.
Next, Associated Bank contends that PNB is estopped from requiring reimbursement because the latter paid and cleared the checks. The Court finds this contention unmeritorious. Even if PNB cleared and paid the checks, it can still recover from Associated Bank. This is true even if the payeeâs Chief Officer who was supposed to have indorsed the checks is also a customer of the drawee bank.
[39]
PNBâs duty was to verify the genuineness of the drawerâs signature and not the genuineness of payeeâs indorsement. Associated Bank, as the collecting bank, is the entity with the duty to verify the genuineness of the payeeâs indorsement.
PNB also avers that respondent court erred in adjudging circuitous liability by directing PNB to return to the Province of Tarlac the amount of the checks and then directing Associated Bank to reimburse PNB. The Court finds nothing wrong with the mode of the award. The drawer, Province of Tarlac, is a client or customer of the PNB, not of Associated Bank. There is no privity of contract between the drawer and the collecting bank.
The trial court made PNB and Associated Bank liable with legal interest from March 20, 1981, the date of extrajudicial demand made by the Province of Tarlac on PNB. The payments to be made in this case stem from the deposits of the Province of Tarlac in its current account with the PNB. Bank deposits are considered under the law as loans.
[40]
Central Bank Circular No. 416 prescribes a twelve percent (12%) interest per annum for loans, forebearance of money, goods or credits in the absence of express stipulation. Normally, current accounts are likewise interest-bearing, by express contract, thus excluding them from the coverage of CB Circular No. 416. In this case, however, the actual interest rate, if any, for the current account opened by the Province of Tarlac with PNB was not given in evidence. Hence, the Court deems it wise to affirm the trial courtâs use of the legal interest rate, or six percent (6%) per annum. The interest rate shall be computed from the date of default, or the date of judicial or extrajudicial demand.
[41]
The trial court did not err in granting legal interest from March 20, 1981, the date of extrajudicial demand.
The Court finds as reasonable, the proportionate sharing of fifty percent - fifty percent (50%-50%). Due to the negligence of the Province of Tarlac in releasing the checks to an unauthorized person (Fausto Pangilinan), in allowing the retired hospital cashier to receive the checks for the payee hospital for a period close to three years and in not properly ascertaining why the retired hospital cashier was collecting checks for the payee hospital in addition to the hospitalâs real cashier, respondent Province contributed to the loss amounting to. P203,300.00 and shall be liable to the PNB for fifty (50%) percent thereof. In effect, the Province of Tarlac can only recover fifty percent (50%) of P203,300.00 from PNB.
The collecting bank, Associated Bank, shall be liable to PNB for fifty (50%) percent of P203,300.00. It is liable on its warranties as indorser of the checks which were deposited by Fausto Pangilinan, having guaranteed the genuineness of all prior indorsements, including that of the chief of the payee hospital, Dr. Adena Canlas. Associated Bank was also remiss in its duty to ascertain the genuineness of the payeeâs indorsement.
IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING,
the petition for review filed by the Philippine National Bank (G.R. No. 107612) is hereby
PARTIALLY GRANTED.
The petition for review filed by the Associated Bank (G.R. No. 107382) is hereby
DENIED.
The decision of the trial court is
MODIFIED.
The Philippine National Bank shall pay fifty percent (50%) of P203,300.00 to the Province of Tarlac, with legal interest from March 20, 1981 until the payment thereof. Associated Bank shall pay fifty percent (50%) of P203,300.00 to the Philippine National Bank, likewise, with legal interest from March 20, 1981 until payment is made.

Provincial aid was given irregularly. Hospital staff would often call the provincial treasurerâs office to inquire whether there was an allotment check for the hospital. The hospitalâs administrative officer and cashier would then go to the provincial treasurerâs office to pick up the check.
Checks received by the hospital are deposited in the account of the National Treasury with the PNB. All income of the hospital in excess of the amount which the National Government has directed it to raise, is excess income. The latter is given back to the hospital after a supplemental budget is prepared. When the latter is approved, an advice of allotment is made. Then the hospital requests a cash disbursement ceiling. When approved, this is brought to the Ministry of Health. The regional office of said Ministry then prepares a check for the hospital. The check will be deposited in the hospitalâs current account at the PNB. (Culled from the testimony of Dr. Adena Canlas, TSN, October 17, 1983, pp. 8-11; December 6, 1983, pp. 43-44).

CEFERINO S. PAREDES, JR. AND MANSUETO J. HONRADA, PETITIONERS, VS. THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN, SECOND DIVISION; HONORABLE ANIANO DESIERTO, IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS SPECIAL PROSECUTOR; HONORABLE CONRADO M. VASQUEZ, IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS OMBUDSMAN; AND TEOFILO GELACIO,Â  RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N
MENDOZA, J.:
This is a petition for certiorari, prohibition and injunction, seeking to set aside the resolution dated December 9, 1992 of the Office of the Ombudsman, denying petitionerâs motion for the reinvestigation of three cases of falsification of public documents which had been filed against petitioners and to restrain the Second Division of the Sandiganbayan from hearing the cases.
The cases originated in a complaint filed on January 23, 1990 by Teofilo Gelacio, then vice mayor of San Francisco, Agusan del Sur. Charged with petitioner Paredes, Jr., who was then the provincial governor, were petitioner Mansueto J. Honrada, clerk of court of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of San Francisco, Agusan del Sur, and Atty. Generoso Sansaet, counsel of petitioner Paredes, Jr. in Criminal Case No. 1393 of the MCTC.
In his complaint Gelacio alleged that MCTC clerk of court Honrada, in conspiracy with petitioner Paredes, Jr. and the latterâs counsel Atty. Sansaet, certified as true a copy of a Notice of Arraignment dated July 1, 1985 and of the Transcript of Stenographic Notes on July 9, 1985, showing that an arraignment had been held in Criminal Case No. 1393 and issued a certification dated March 24, 1986 to that effect when in truth no arraignment had been held in that case. In support of his allegation, Gelacio submitted a Certification issued by Judge Ciriaco C. AriÃ±o of the MCTC to the effect that Criminal Case No. 1393 had ""never reached the arraignment stage"" before it was dismissed on motion of the prosecution.
[1]
A preliminary investigation of the complaint was conducted by Public Prosecutor Albert Axalan who had been deputized to assist the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao. Petitioners and Atty. Sansaet, as respondents in the case, filed their respective counter-affidavits. Paredes, Jr. denied the charges. He alleged that their filing was politically motivated and that the complainant, Teofilo Gelacio, was being used by his political enemies to harass him. For his part, Honrada maintained that an arraignment had indeed been held in Criminal Case No. 1393 as certified by him. His claim was corroborated by Atty. Generoso Sansaet, who stated in an affidavit that he was present during the arraignment, being the counsel of Paredes, Jr. Sansaet called Judge AriÃ±oâs Certification, denying that there was an arraignment, the product ""of a faltering mind.""
[2]
Prosecutor Axalan submitted his resolution to the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao, but before it could be acted upon, Atty. Sansaet, one of the respondents, retracted his earlier statement to the effect that Paredes, Jr. had been arraigned before the case against him was dismissed. In an Affidavit of Explanations and Rectifications dated July 29, 1991, Sansaet claimed that there was really no arraignment held in Criminal Case No. 1393 and that Honrada made false certifications which were used to support the dismissal (on the ground of double jeopardy) of Criminal Case No. 13800 which was then pending against Paredes, Jr. in the Sandiganbayan.
[3]
As a result of this development, Paredes, Jr. and Honrada, were required to comment. Paredes, Jr. claimed that the Sansaetâs aboutface was the result of their political estrangement.
[4]
For his part Honrada insisted that an arraignment in Criminal Case No. 1393 had indeed been held and that in making the certifications in question he stated the truth.
On the basis of the evidence of the parties, Gay Maggie Balajadia-Violan, Graft Investigation Officer of the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman, recommended on February 24, 1992 that petitioners and Atty. Sansaet be charged with Falsification of Public Documents. Her recommendation was indorsed by Deputy Ombudsman Cesar Nitorreda to Ombudsman Conrado Vasquez, Who, upon the recommendation of Erdulfo Querubin of the Office of the Special Prosecutor, approved the filing of three informations for falsification of public documents against Paredes, Jr., Honrada and Sansaet with the Sandiganbayan.
[5]
The cases were docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 17791, 17792 and 17793.
On July 9, 1992, petitioners moved to quash the informations. Their motion was denied by the Sandiganbayan in its resolution of August 25, 1992, as was the motion for reconsideration they subsequently filed.
Petitioners next moved for a reinvestigation of the cases. They complained (1) that the resolution, recommending the filing of the cases, was not prepared by Public Prosecutor Axalan, who had conducted the preliminary investigation, but by GIO II Gay Maggie Balajadia-Violan, who allegedly had no hand in the investigation; (2) that Violan relied solely on the retraction of Atty. Generoso Sansaet and the Certification of Judge Ciriaco C. AriÃ±o and disregarded evidence in favor of petitioners; and (3) that Prosecutor Erdulfo Q. Querubin, who reviewed Violanâs recommendation, could not be expected to act fairly because he was the prosecutor in Criminal Case No. 13800 in connection with which the allegedly falsified records were used and in fact appealed the dismissal of the case to this Court.
[6]
Although these grounds were the same ones invoked by petitioners in their motion to quash, which the Sandiganbayan had denied, the Sandiganbayan nonetheless directed the prosecution to conduct a reinvestigation of the cases. Accordingly, the Office of the Ombudsman required complainant, the herein respondent Teofilo Gelacio, to comment on petitionersâ Motion for Reinvestigation.
In a resolution dated December 9, 1992, Special Prosecution Officer Carlos D. Montemayor recommended denial of petitionersâ motion. He noted that the matters raised in the motion were the same ones contained in petitionersâ motion to quash which had already been denied and that in fact ""a cursory examination of the resolution of GIO II Gay Maggie Balajadia-Violan shows that the existence of a prima facie case has been duly established and the same was reviewed by SPO III Erdulfo Querubin and also the approval of Honorable Conrado M. Vasquez."" He held that as no newly-discovered evidence or denial of due process had been shown, there was no basis for petitionersâ request for a reinvestigation.
Montemayorâs recommendation was approved by Special Prosecutor Aniano Desierto and Ombudsman Conrado Vasquez. Accordingly the Sandiganbayan set the cases for trial.
The present petition for certiorari, prohibition and injunction was then filed to enjoin the trial of the criminal cases. Petitioners pray that:
(1) Upon the filing of this petition and before its final resolution, to issue a temporary restraining order immediately ordering the Sandiganbayan, Second Division, to cease and desist from proceeding with the scheduled hearing of this case;
(2) After due hearing, to adjudge that respondents Honorable Special Prosecutor Aniano A. Desierto and Honorable Ombudsman Conrado M. Vasquez have committed grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack of jurisdiction, in issuing and approving the questioned resolution dated December 9, 1992 and ordering said resolution denying petitionersâ motion for reinvestigation be annulled and set aside;
(3) To adjudge that the Sandiganbayan, Second Division, is without jurisdiction to try Criminal Case Nos. 17791, 17792, and 17793 all of which are apparently intended as political harassments against the herein petitioners, particularly as against Ceferino S. Paredes, Jr., and prohibiting the said court from proceeding (with) the hearing of the said cases on January 15, 1993, and likewise ordering the said court to dismiss the said cases, with costs against respondents and Teofilo Gelacio; and
(4) To issue a writ of injunction, thereby making the restraining order permanent, and prohibiting the respondents and complainant Teofilo Gelacio from committing any act or acts tending to harass and to inflict further damage and injury to petitioners, such as but not limited to the continuation and further prosecution of said Criminal Cases Nos. 17791, 17792, and 17793.
Petitioners contend (1) that their constitutional right to due process was violated at various stages of the preliminary investigation; (2) that the prosecutors closed their eyes to the fact that in filing the cases private respondent Teofilo Gelacio engaged in forum-shopping; and (3) that the cases were filed for political harassment and there is in fact no prima facie evidence to hold them answerable for falsification of public documents.
[7]
I.
Anent the first ground, petitioners contend that the filing of charges against them was not recommended by the prosecutor who conducted the preliminary investigation, but by another one who, it is alleged, had no part at all in the investigation.
Petitionersâ contention has no basis in fact. It appears that the preliminary investigation of the complaint filed by Teofilo Gelacio was initially conducted by Public Prosecutor Albert Axalan who had been deputized to assist the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao in the investigation of graft cases. Axalan prepared a resolution. The records do not show what his recommendation was. What is clear, however, is that no action had been taken on his recommendation in view of the fact that Atty. Generoso Sansaet, one of the respondents in the cases, retracted an earlier statement he had given to the effect that petitioner Ceferino S. Paredes, Jr. had been arraigned in Criminal Case No. 1393 before the case was dismissed. Atty. Sansaet now claimed that no arraignment had been held after all. This new development required the reopening of the investigation (in fact Paredes, Jr. and Honrada were required to comment on the retraction), the reevaluation of the evidence, and the preparation of a new resolution. Gay Maggie Balajadia-Violan, Graft Investigation Officer II of the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao, was designated to conduct the investigation and prepare a report, which she did.
Violanâs recommendation was indorsed by Deputy Ombudsman Cesar Nitorreda to Ombudsman Conrado Vasquez, who then referred the matter to Special Prosecution Officer Ill Erdulfo Querubin for review. Querubin concurred in the recommendation of Violan but suggested that, instead of one, three separate informations for falsification of public documents be filed against respondents (Paredes, Jr., Honrada and Sansaet), considering that three documents were involved.
On June 26, 1992, Ombudsman Conrado Vasquez approved the recommendations of Violan and Querubin. Accordingly three cases were filed against petitioners with the Sandiganbayan, where they were docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 17791, 17792 and 17793.
There is thus no basis for petitionersâ claim that the resolution was prepared by one who did not take any part in the investigation. What happened here is similar to the trial of a case by one judge who, without being able to finish the hearing, ceases from office for one reason or another and by necessity the decision is rendered by another judge who has taken over the conduct of the case. Such an arrangement has never been thought to raise any question of due process. For what is important is that the judge who decides does so on the basis of the evidence in record. It does not matter that he did not conduct the hearing of that case from the beginning.
Petitioners nonetheless charge that GIO II Violan and Prosecutor Querubin did not have such cold neutrality of an impartial judge to be trusted to conduct a fair investigation. According to petitioners, Violan gave credence to the Certification issued by Judge Ciriaco C. AriÃ±o when the fact is that Judge AriÃ±o subsequently executed an affidavit, dated November 5, 1990, in which he explained that ""he issued the said certificate without expectation that the same would be used as evidence in any case"" and that the ""use of said certificate . . . is against [his] conscience."" Worse, it is contended, Violan considered the Affidavit of Explanations and Rectifications executed by Atty. Sansaet, which she should have disregarded because it was made in violation of the confidentiality of attorney-client communication under Rule 130, Â§ 24 (b) of the Rules of Court. As for Prosecutor Querubin, they claim that he is the same prosecutor who had handled the prosecution of Criminal Case No. 13800 against petitioner Paredes, Jr. in the Sandiganbayan and after its dismissal, sought review in this Court and, therefore, he was biased against petitioners.
That Violan gave credence to the Certification of Judge AriÃ±o in concluding that no arraignment had been held in Criminal Case No. 1393 is not proof that Violan was biased against petitioners. Although Judge AriÃ±o subsequently gave an Affidavit, he never in that Affidavit repudiated what he had earlier stated. In his Affidavit he merely stated:
1.  That I am the incumbent Municipal Circuit Trial Court Judge in the First Municipal Circuit Trial Court of San Francisco-Rosario-Bunawan, Agusan del Sur;
2.  That I am the same Ciriaco C. AriÃ±o who issued a certificate in Criminal Case No. 1393 entitled Pp. vs. Ceferino S. Paredes, Jr. which certificate was used as evidence in administrative complaint against Mansueto J. Honrada, in the Administrative Complaint No. A.M. P-90-396 and Criminal Complaint against Mansueto J. Honrada, incumbent Governor Ceferino S. Paredes, Jr. and Atty. Generoso S. Sansaet before the Ombudsman under Criminal Case No. OBM-MIN-90-0053 (sic) entitled Teofilo Gelacio vs. Mansueto J. Honrada, et. al.;
3.  That honestly, the said certificate was issued without my expectation that the same be used as evidence in any case and I be a witness;
4.  That the use of said certificate as evidence in the above-mentioned cases is against my conscience, more so upon discovery that the cases aforesaid are known to me to be politically motivated and involves [sic] big time politicians in Agusan del Sur about whom I am not at liberty to name names for security reason;
5.  That in view of all the foregoing, I am not interested to testify in any investigation to be conducted in connection thereof, either in the administrative or criminal proceedings.
Thus, Judge AriÃ±o never denied his earlier Certification that Criminal Case No. 1393 ""never reached the arraignment stage,"" because having learned that Paredes, Jr. had petitioned the Ministry of Justice for a review of the fiscalâs resolution, Judge AriÃ±o suspended action until March 17, 1986 and in fact the fiscal later moved for the dismissal of the case.
The fact that Judge AriÃ±o did not anticipate that his certificate might be used in evidence, much less in the criminal cases now pending in the Sandiganbayan, is not a reason to disregard it. The fact is that Judge AriÃ±o did not retract his previous Certification that there was no arraignment held in Criminal Case No. 1393. If that is the truth, then the fact that he now says he did not anticipate that his certificate would be used in evidence in any case would not diminish a whit the value of the certificate.
Nor was consideration of the retraction of Atty. Sansaet proof that GIO II Violan was biased against petitioners. Petitioners contend that Sansaetâs confession was privileged and that Violan herself acknowledged that the affidavit of retraction might be inadmissible in court.
In the first place, there is nothing in the resolution of Violan which shows that she based her conclusion (that petitioners were probably guilty of falsification of public documents) on Atty. Sansaetâs retraction. In her resolution, all that she stated is that ""the confession of Atty. Sansaet has important bearing in this case."" Otherwise she did not cite the confession as proof of the falsification of public documents. To the contrary, Violan thought that the retraction was made in violation of attorney-client privilege and therefore, would be inadmissible in evidence. Violan could not, therefore, have relied on the affidavit of retraction.
Moreover, the admissibility of this piece of evidence is a question for the Sandiganbayan to determine in the event it is used by the prosecution. It is untenable to ascribe bias and partiality to the investigator because she considered this retraction in her resolution of the case. Even if she relied on it mere ""divergence of opinions between a judge and a partyâs counsel as to applicable laws and jurisprudence is not sufficient ground for disqualifying the judge from hearing the case on the ground of bias and partiality.""
[8]
As for Prosecutor Querubin, simply because he was the one who handled the prosecution of Criminal Case No. 13800, in connection with which the documents allegedly falsified were used by petitioners, is not a reason for supposing he could not act fairly. As any other counsel in a case, it was his duty to act with ""full devotion to [his clientâs] genuine interests, warm zeal in the maintenance and defense of his rights, and the exertion of his utmost learning and ability.""
[9]
It cannot be casually assumed that because of his engagement in that case he had lost his objectivity to such an extent that he forsook his duty to see to it that justice was done and not to act out of vindictiveness.
Indeed, Querubin is a public prosecutor, not a private attorney. In the familiar terminology, he is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case but that justice shall be done.
[10]
It may therefore be assumed that he was merely performing an official duty and that nothing personal was involved in his recommendation to prosecute the cases.
Above all, it should be stressed that the decision to charge petitioners in the Sandiganbayan was the decision not only of one person but of all those who in one way or another were called upon to act in the cases, namely: Graft Investigation Officer Gay Maggie Balajadia-Violan, Deputy Ombudsman Cesar Nitorreda, Ombudsman Conrado Vasquez, and Special Prosecutor Aniano Desierto. Indeed, Querubinâs only contribution to the process was to suggest the filing of three separate informations of falsification of public documents against petitioners.
II.
The second ground for the petition is that the Office of the Ombudsman closed its eyes to the fact that in filing these cases, complainant Teofilo Gelacio is guilty of forum-shopping and that his purpose for the filing of the cases is simply political harassment. To buttress their contention, petitioners call attention to the factual background of the cases.
[11]
According to petitioners, way back in 1984 private respondent Teofilo Gelacio charged petitioner Paredes, Jr. with perjury on the ground that in 1975 Paredes, Jr. made false statements in an affidavit which he used in support of his application for a free patent. As already noted, the case which was filed with the Municipal Trial Court of San Francisco, Agusan del Sur, and docketed there as Criminal Case No. 1393, was dismissed on March 24, 1986 upon motion of the prosecution.
On October 28, 1986, Teofilo Gelacio filed another complaint against petitioner Paredes, Jr., then the acting governor of the province. The complaint was for violation of Â§ 3 (a) of Republic Act 3019, otherwise known as Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. Allegedly, in 1976 petitioner Paredes, Jr., then the Provincial Attorney of Agusan del Sur, unduly ""persuaded, induced and influenced"" the Public Land Inspector to approve his (Paredes, Jrâs) application for a free patent. According to petitioners, this case involved the same application for a free patent of petitioner Paredes, Jr., which was the subject of Criminal Case No. 1393.
The information was filed by Special Prosecutor Erdulfo Querubin in the Sandiganbayan where it was docketed as Criminal Case No. 13800. Petitioner Paredes, Jr. moved to quash the information, but the court denied his motion. He then filed a motion for reconsideration. It was in connection with this motion that the procurement of allegedly falsified documents, now the subject of prosecution, was made by petitioner Paredes, Jr. The documents were used to support his motion for reconsideration.
On August 1, 1991, the Sandiganbayan reconsidered its previous resolution and dismissed Criminal Case No. 13800, although on the ground of prescription. The Office of the Ombudsman sought a review of the action of the Sandiganbayan, but its petition was dismissed by this Court on July 3, 1992 in G.R. No. 101724. The motion for reconsideration filed by the prosecution was likewise denied.
As an offshoot of the execution of these documents, two cases were filed by Teofilo Gelacio: (1) an administrative complaint (A.P. Case No. P-90-3 96) for falsification of public documents which was filed with this Court against Mansueto Honrada, the clerk of the MCTC who made certifications and (2) a complaint for falsification of public documents, initially filed as OMB-MIN-90-0053 with the Office of the Ombudsman and eventually as Criminal Case Nos. 17791, 17792, and 17793 in the Sandiganbayan, against the petitioners and Atty. Generoso Sansaet.
The first case was dismissed for insufficiency of the evidence. But with respect to the second complaint, Graft Investigation Officer Violan found probable cause to proceed against petitioners and against Atty. Sansaet and so recommended the filing of a case against them. Her recommendation was approved by the Ombudsman on June 26, 1992, although upon the recommendation of Special Prosecutor Querubin three separate informations were filed with the Sandiganbayan. Earlier on July 29, 1991, Atty. Sansaet, one of the respondents, executed an Affidavit of Explanations and Rectifications in which he stated that, contrary to his previous affidavit, there was no arraignment held in Criminal Case No. 1393.
A. Petitioners contend that these cases should be dismissed, being merely the latest in a series of cases which ""arose out of the same alleged incident - i.e. that of allegedly having induced the land inspector to approve his (Paredes, Jr.âs) land application,""
[12]
for having been filed in violation of the rules on forum-shopping. Petitioners cite the following statement in Crisostomo v. Securities and Exchange Commission:
[13]
There is forum-shopping whenever as a result of an adverse opinion in one forum, a party seeks a favorable opinion (other than by appeal or certiorari) in another. The principle applies not only with respect to suits filed in the courts while an administrative proceeding is pending as in this case, in order to defeat administrative processes and in anticipation of an unfavorable administrative ruling and a favorable court ruling. . . A violation of this rule shall constitute contempt of court and shall be a cause for summary dismissal of both petitions, without prejudice to the taking of appropriate action against the counsel or the party concerned.
The mere filing of several cases based on the same incident does not necessarily constitute forum-shopping. The test is whether the several actions filed involve the same transactions, essential facts, and circumstances.
[14]
Here, although several cases were filed by the same complainant against the same defendant and the subject matter of the actions of two of the cases was the same incident (i.e., the application for free patent of petitioner Ceferino Paredes, Jr.), the fact is that the several cases involve essentially different facts, circumstances and causes of action.
Thus, Criminal Case No. 1393, which was filed in the MCTC of San Francisco, Agusan del Sur, was for perjury, based on false statements allegedly made in 1975 by petitioner Paredes, Jr. in connection with his free patent application. Criminal Case No. 13800, which was filed in the Sandiganbayan, although based on the filing of the same application for free patent, was for violation of the Anti-graft and Corrupt Practices Act, on the allegation that petitioner, as Provincial Attorney, had unduly influenced the Public Land Inspector to secure the approval of his free patent application. On the other hand, as already stated, the present cases (Criminal Case Nos. 17791, 17792 and 17793) are for falsification of court records pertaining to Criminal Case No. 1393. A.P. Case No. P-90-396 is an administrative case against petitioner Honrada based on the same incident and facts that are subject of the preceding criminal cases. The rest are incidents of these cases, being the petition for review and motions for reconsideration in Criminal Case No. 13800 and A.P. Case No. P-90-396.
Thus the present cases involve substantially different transactions, facts and circumstances from those involved in the other, though related, cases. Although they arose from the same incident, i.e., petitionerâs public land application, they involve different issues. It is well settled that a single act may offend against two or more distinct and related provisions of law
[15]
or that the same act may give rise to criminal as well as administrative liability.
[16]
As such, they may be prosecuted simultaneously or one after another, so long as they do not place the accused in double jeopardy of being punished for the same offense.
Petitioners call attention to the fact that the administrative complaint against petitioner Honrada was dismissed. They invoke our ruling in
Maceda v. Vasquez
[17]
that only this Court has the power to oversee court personnelâs compliance with laws and take the appropriate administrative action against them for their failure to do so and that no other branch of the government may exercise this power without running afoul of the principle of separation of powers.
But one thing is administrative liability. Quite another thing is the criminal liability for the same act. Our determination of the administrative liability for falsification of public documents is in no way conclusive of his lack of criminal liability. As we have held in
Tan v. Comelec,
[18]
the dismissal of an administrative case does not necessarily bar the filing of a criminal prosecution for the same or similar acts which were the subject of the administrative complaint.
Petitionerâs assertion that private respondent Alterado has resorted to forum-shopping is unacceptable. The investigation then being conducted by the Ombudsman on the criminal case for falsification and violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, on the one hand, and the inquiry into the administrative charges by the COMELEC, on the other hand, are entirely independent proceedings.
Neither would the results in one conclude the other. Thus an absolution from a criminal charge is not a bar to an administrative prosecution (Office of the Court administrator v. Enriquez, 218 SCRA 1) or vice versa.
[19]
B. As final argument, petitioners allege that the complaint in Criminal Case Nos. 17791, 17792 and 17793 was filed by political enemies of petitioner Paredes, Jr. merely to harass him and that there is in fact no probable cause to support the prosecution of these cases. Petitioners cite the following which allegedly indicate that the charges below have merely been trumped up:
(1) The affidavit of Agusan del Sur District Citizenâs Attorney Lou Nueva, stating that then Congressman Democrito O. Plaza instructed Atty. Leonardo Cadiz to secure a certification from Judge Ciriaco C. AriÃ±o that no arraignment had been held in Criminal Case No. 1393, threatening that if the judge refused to give the certification, he (Congressman Plaza) would do ""everything against Judge Ciriaco C. AriÃ±o,"" including""reviving certain cases against Judge AriÃ±o"";
[20]
and (2) The affidavit, dated November 5, 1990, of Judge AriÃ±o in which he stated that he did not expect that the certificate which he had previously issued would be used in evidence and that the use of the certificate in the cases below was ""against his conscience,"" because the cases were politically motivated and he was not going to testify in any investigation concerning such certificate.
[21]
At the same time petitioners seek to minimize the retraction of Atty. Sansaet by ascribing political motivation for its execution. Petitioner Ceferino Paredes, Jr. claims that Sansaetâs obsession has been to win in an election and that his loss to petitioner Paredes, Jr. in the May 11, 1992 congressional elections was Sansaetâs sixth defeat. As for private respondent Teofilo Gelacio, petitioners say he is a political leader of Democrito Plaza. They claim that in 1991 Atty. Sansaet changed political affiliation and allied himself with Democrito Plaza and Teofilo Gelacio.
Petitioners argue that the certifications made by the clerk of court with respect to an arraignment allegedly held on July 9, 1985 in Criminal Case No. 1393 is conclusive and cannot be altered by Atty. Sansaetâs claim to the contrary. They cite what is now Rule 132, Â§ 23 of the Revised Rules on Evidence, which provides that ""public instruments are evidence, even against a third person, of the fact which gave rise to their execution and of the date of the latter.""
We find the foregoing averments to be unpersuasive. First of all, that the filing of the charges is politically motivated cannot justify the prohibition of a criminal prosecution if there is otherwise evidence to support them. Here a preliminary investigation of the complaint against petitioners was held during which petitioners were heard. Their evidence, as well as that of private respondent Gelacio, was considered in great detail in the resolution of GIO II Violan. Violanâs resolution was reviewed by Special Prosecutor Erdulfo Querubin who made his own detailed resolution concurring in the finding of ViolÃ¡n. We cannot say that, in approving the resolutions of two investigators, the respondent Ombudsman and Special Prosecutor committed an abuse of their discretion.
Indeed, this Court is loath to interfere with the discretion of the Ombudsman unless such discretion is clearly shown to have been abused. As explained in
Young v. Office
of the Ombudsman:
[22]
The rule is based not only upon respect for the investigatory and prosecutory powers granted by the Constitution to the Office of the Ombudsman but upon practicality as well. Otherwise, the functions of the courts will be grievously hampered by innumerable petitions assailing the dismissal of investigatory proceedings conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman with regard to complaints filed before it, in much the same way that the courts would be extremely swamped if they could be compelled to review the exercise of discretion on the part of the fiscals or prosecuting attorneys each time they decide to file an information in court or dismiss a complaint by a private complainant.
There are instances, constituting exceptions to the general rule, when this Court will intervene in the prosecution of cases. Some of these instances were enumerated in
Brocka v. Enrile,
[23]
as follows:
a.  Where injunction is justified by the necessity to afford protection to the constitutional rights of the accused; (Hernandez vs. Albano, et al., L-19272, January 25, 1967, 19 SCRA 95)
b.  When necessary for the orderly administration of justice or to avoid oppression or multiplicity of actions; (Dimayuga, et al. vs. Fernandez, 43 Phil. 304; Hernandez vs. Albano, supra; Fortun vs. Labang, et al. L-38383, May 27 1981, 104 SCRA 607)
c.  When there is a prejudicial question which is sub judice;. (De Leon vs. Mabanag, 70 Phil. 202)
d.  When the acts of the officer are without or in excess of authority; (Planas vs. Gil, 67 Phil 62)
e.  Where the prosecution is under an invalid law, ordinance or regulation; (Young vs. Rafferty, 33 Phil 556; Yu Co Eng vs. Trinidad, 47 Phil. 385, 389)
f.   When double jeopardy is clearly apparent; (Sangalang vs. People and Avendia, 109 Phil. 1140)
g.  Where the court has no jurisdiction over the offense; (Lopez vs. City Judge, L-25795, October 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 616).
h.  Where it is a case of persecution rather than prosecution; (Rustia vs. Ocampo, CA-G.R. No. 4760, March 25, 1960)
i.   Where the charges are manifestly false and motivated by the lust for vengeance; (Recto vs. Castelo, 18 L.J. (1953), cited in Ranoa vs. Alvendia, CA G.R. No. 30720-R, October 8, 1962; cf Guingona, et al. vs. City Fiscal, L-60033, April 4, 1984, 128 SCRA 577).
j.   When there is clearly no prima facie case against the accused and motion to quash on that ground has been denied; (Salonga vs. Pano, et al., L-59524, February 18, 1985, 134 SCRA 438); and
k.  Preliminary injunction has been issued by the Supreme Court to prevent the threatened unlawful arrest of petitioners. (Rodriguez vs. Castelo, L-6374, August 1, 1953) (cited in Regalado, REMEDIAL LAW COMPENDIUM, p. 188 1988 Ed).
But none of these instances is present here.
What petitioners raise are questions which go to the weight to be given to the affidavits by Atty. Nueva and Judge AriÃ±o. These are matters for the trial courtâs appreciation. A preliminary investigation is not a trial. The function of the government prosecutor during the preliminary investigation is merely to determine the existence of probable cause.
[24]
As we explained in
Pilapil vs. Sandiganbayan,
[25]
this function involves only the following:
Probable cause is a reasonable ground of presumption that a matter is, or may be, well-founded, such a state of facts in the mind of the prosecutor as would lead a person of ordinary caution and prudence to believe, or entertain an honest or strong suspicion, that a thing is so. (Words and Phrases, Probable Cause v. 34, p. 12) The term does not mean ""actual and positive cause"" nor does it import absolute certainty. It is merely based on opinion and reasonable belief. Thus a finding of probable cause does not require an inquiry into whether there is sufficient evidence to procure a conviction. It is enough that it is believed that the act or omission complained of constitutes the offense charged. Precisely, there is a trial for the reception of evidence of the prosecution in support of the charge.
Secondly, to warrant a finding of political harassment so as to justify the grant of the extraordinary writs of certiorari and prohibition, it must be shown that the complainant possesses the power and the influence to control the prosecution of cases. Here, the prosecution is handled by the Office of the Ombudsman. Although it is intimated that Petitioner Ceferino S. Paredes, Jr. is the subject of persecution by his political enemies in Agusan del Sur, it has not been alleged, much less shown, that his enemies have influence and power over the national prosecution service.
To show political harassment petitioners must prove that public prosecutor, and not just the private complainant, is acting in bad faith in prosecuting the case
[26]
or has lent himself to a scheme that could have no other purpose than to place the accused in contempt and disrepute.
[27]
For it is only if he does so may the prosecutor, in conducting the preliminary investigation, be said to have deserted the performance of his office to determine objectively and impartially the existence of probable cause and thus justify judicial intervention in what is essentially his province.
WHEREFORE,
the petition for certiorari and prohibition is
DISMISSED.
SO ORDERED.

JOHANNA SOMBONG, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND MARIETTA NERI ALVIAR, LILIBETH NERI AND ALLPERSONS HOLDING THE SUBJECT CHILD ARABELA SOMBONG IN THEIR CUSTODY, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N
HERMOSISIMA, JR., J.:
Every soâ often two women claim to be the legitimate parent of the same child. One or the other, whether for financial gain or for sheer cupidity, should be an impostor. The court is consequently called upon to decide as to which of them should have the childâs lawful custody. This is the very nature of this case. The child herein had considerably grown through the years that this controversy had unbearably lagged. The wisdom of the ages should be of some help, delicate as the case considerably is. The earliest recorded decision on the matter is extant in the Bible, I Kings 3. As it appears, King Solomon in all his glory resolved the controversy posed by two women claiming the same child:
""And the King said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the King.
""And the King said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
""Then spoke the woman whose the living child was unto the King, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my Lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.
""Then the King answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof."" (1 Kings, Chapter 3, Verses 25-27)
King Solomonâs wisdom, was inspired by God:
""And all Israel heard of the judgment which the King had judged; and they feared the King: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment."" (
Ibid
., Verse 28)
We do resolve the herein controversy inspired by Godâs own beloved King.
The Petition for Review on Certiorari before us seeks the reversal of the decision
[1]
of respondent Court of Appeals
[2]
which had reversed the decision
[3]
of the Regional Trial Court
[4]
which granted the Petition for Habeas Corpus filed by petitioner.
The following facts were developed by the evidence presented by the opposing parties:
Petitioner is the mother of Arabella O. Sombong who was born on April 23, 1987 in Signal Village, Taguig, Metro Manila.
[5]
Some time in November, 1987, Arabella, then only six months old, was brought to the Sir John Clinic, located at 121 First Avenue, Kalookan City, for relief of coughing fits and for treatment of colds. Petitioner did not have enough money to pay the hospital bill in the amount of P300.00. Arabella could not be discharged, then, because of the petitionerâs failure to pay the bill.
Petitioner surprisingly gave testimony to the effect that she allegedly paid the private respondents by installments in the total amount of P1,700.00, knowing for a fact that the sum payable was only P300.00. Despite such alleged payments, the owners of the clinic, Dra. Carmen Ty and her husband, Mr. Vicente Ty, allegedly refused to turn over Arabella to her. Petitioner claims that the reason for such a refusal was that she refused to go out on a date with Mr. Ty, who had been courting her. This allegedly gave Dra. Ty a reason to be jealous of her, making it difficult for everyone all around.
On the other hand and in contrast to her foregoing allegations, petitioner testified that she visited Arabella at the clinic only after two years, i.e., in 1989. This time, she did not go beyond berating the spouses Ty for their refusal to give Arabella to her. Three years thereafter, i.e., in 1992, petitioner again resurfaced to lay claim to her child. Her pleas allegedly fell on deaf ears.
Consequently, on May 21, 1992, petitioner filed a petition with the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City for the issuance of a Writ of Habeas Corpus against the spouses Ty. She alleged therein that Arabella was being unlawfully detained and imprisoned at No. 121, First Avenue, Grace Park, Kalookan City. The petition was denied due course and summarily dismissed,
[6]
without prejudice, on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, the alleged detention having been perpetrated in Kalookan City.
Petitioner, thereafter, filed a criminal complaint
[7]
with the Office of the City Prosecutor of Kalookan City against the spouses Ty. Dr. Ty, in her counter-affidavit, admitted that petitionerâs child, Arabella, had for some time been in her custody. Arabella was discharged from the clinic in April, 1989, and was, in the presence of her clinic staff, turned over to someone who was properly identified to be the childâs guardian.
In the face of the refusal of the spouses Ty to turn over Arabella to her, she had sought the help of Barangay Captains Alfonso and Bautista of Kalookan City, Mayor Asistio of the same city, and even Congresswoman Hortensia L. Starke of Negros Occidental. Their efforts to help availed her nothing.
On September 4, 1992, the Office of the City Prosecutor of Kalookan City, on the basis of petitionerâs complaint, filed an information
[8]
against the spouses Ty for Kidnapping and Illegal Detention of a Minor before the Regional Trial Court of Kalookan City.
[9]
On September 16, 1992, an order for the arrest of the spouses Ty was issued in the criminal case. Facing arrest, Dra. Ty disclosed the possibility that the child, Arabella, may be found at No. 23 Jesus Street, San Francisco del Monte, Quezon City. The agents of the National Bureau of Investigation went to said address and there found a female child who answered to the name of Cristina Grace Neri. Quite significantly, the evidence disclosed that the child, Cristina, had been living with respondent Marietta Neri Alviar since 1988. When she was just a baby, Cristina was abandoned by her parents at the Sir John Clinic. On April 18, 1988, Dr. Fe Mallonga, a dentist at the Sir John Clinic and niece of both Dra. Ty and respondent Alviar, called the latter up to discuss the possibility of turning over to her care one of the several abandoned babies at the said clinic. Respondent Alviar was told that this baby whose name was unknown had long been abandoned by her parents and appeared to be very small, very thin, and full of scabies. Taking pity on the baby, respondent Alviar and her mother, Maura Salacup Neri, decided to take care of her.
This baby was baptized at the Good Samaritan Church on April 30, 1988. Her Certificate of Baptism
[10]
indicates her name to be Cristina Grace S. Neri; her birthday to be April 30, 1987; her birthplace to be Quezon City; and her foster father and foster mother to be Cicero Neri and Maura Salacup, respectively. Respondent Alviar was invited by the National Bureau of Investigation for questioning on September 22, 1992 in the presence of Dra. Ty and petitioner. Cristina was also brought along by said respondent. At that confrontation, Dra. Ty could not be sure that Cristina was indeed petitionerâs child, Arabella. Neither could petitioner with all certainty say that Cristina was her long lost daughter.
On October 13, 1992, petitioner filed a petition for the issuance of a Writ of Habeas Corpus with the Regional Trial Court
[11]
of Quezon City. The trial court conducted a total of eight (8) hearings, for the period, from October 28, 1992 to December 11, 1992. On January 15, 1993, it rendered a decision granting the Petition for Habeas Corpus and ordering respondent Alviar to immediately deliver the person of Cristina Grace Neri to the petitioner, the court having found Cristina to be the petitionerâs long lost child, Arabella.
The trial court, in justification of its conclusions,
discussed
that:
""On the issue of whether or not the minor child, in question, is the daughter of the petitioner, there seems to be no question, to the mind of this Court, that the petitioner, is, indeed, the mother of the child, registered by the name of Arabella O. Sombong, per her Certificate of Birth x x x and later caused to be baptized as Cristina Grace S. Nery (sic) x x x For, this child is the same child which was delivered by the Sir John Clinic at Kalookan City, owned by Dra. Carmen Ty, to Dra. Fe Mallonga and later given to the custody of the respondents. In fact, Dra. Carmen Ty, in her testimony admitted that the petitioner is the mother of Arabella xxx
On the question of whether or not the petitioner has the rightful custody of the minor child, in question, which is being withheld by the respondents from her, as will authorize the granting of the petition for habeas corpus x x x there is no question that the minor x x x is only about five (5) years old x x x it follows that the child must not be separated from the mother, who is the petitioner, unless, of course, this Court finds compelling reasons to order otherwise.
Heretofore, under the New Civil Code of the Philippines, the compelling reasons which may deprive the parents of their authority or suspend exercise thereof are stated. It was then provided in Article 332, supra, that:
âThe courts may deprive the parents of their authority x x x if they should treat their children with excessive harshness x x x or abandon them. x x xâ (Italics supplied by the RTC)
Unfortunately, the foregoing article, which was under Title XI, parental authority, was expressly repealed by Article 254 of the Family Code of the Philippines xxx
xxx       xxx                               xxx
It can be seen, therefore, that the words âor abandoned themâ mentioned in Article 332 of the New Civil Code x x x is (sic) no longer mentioned in the amending (of) Art. 231 of the Family Code of the Philippines.
It is clear x x x that under the law presently controlling, abandonment is no longer considered a compelling reason upon the basis of which the Court may separate the child below seven (7) years old from the mother.
Conceivably, however, in paragraph 6 of Article 231, supra, the effects of culpable negligence on the part of the parent may be considered by this Court in suspending petitionerâs parental authority over her daughter, in question x x x
The question, therefore, is whether there is culpable negligence on the part of the petitioner so that her parental authority over her child, in question, may at least be suspended by this Court.
This Court is not persuaded that the petitioner is guilty of culpable negligence vis-a-vis her daughter, in question, upon the bases of the facts adduced. For, there is no question that from April, 1988 she kept on demanding from Dra. Carmen Ty x x x the return of her child to her but the latter refused even to see her or to talk to her. Neither did Vicente Ty, the husband of Dra. Carmen Ty, respond to her entreaties to return her daughter.
xxx                          xxx                              xxx
Besides, in the interim, while petitioner was looking for her daughter, she made representations for her recovery with Barangay Captains Alfonso and Bautista, and Mayor Asistio, all of Kalookan City, as well as with Congresswoman Hortensia L. Starke to intervene in her behalf.
It cannot be said, therefore, no matter how remotely, that the petitioner was negligent, nay culpably, in her efforts for the recovery of her daughter.
xxx                          xxx                                    xxx
Certainly, the respondents have no right to the parental authority of the child, superior to that of the petitioner as they are not her parents. They have, therefore, no right to the custody of petitionerâs daughter. The Sir John Clinic, or Dra. Carmen Ty, have (sic) no right to deliver the child, in question, to Dra. Fe Mallonga. Neither had the latter the right and the authority to gave (sic) the child to the respondents, whose custody of petitionerâs daughter is, consequently, illegal.""
[12]
Herein private respondents filed an appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court to the Court of Appeals. The Appellate Court took cognizance of the following issues: (1) The propriety of the habeas corpus proceeding vis-a-vis the problem respecting the identity of the child subject of said proceeding; (2) If indeed petitioner be the mother of the child in question, what the effect would proof of abandonment be under the circumstances of the case; and (3) Will the question of the childâs welfare be the paramount consideration in this case which involves child custody.
The Court of Appeals reversed and set aside the decision of the trial court, ruling as it did that:
""x x x the lower court erred in sweepingly concluding that petitionerâs child Arabella Sombong and respondentsâ foster child Cristina Neri are one and the same person to warrant the issuance of the writ. x x x
As clearly stated in the facts of this case, not even petitioner herself could recognize her own child when respondentsâ foster child Cristina Neri was presented to her before the NBI and respondent court. Dr. Carmen Ty at the NB! investigation could not also ascertain whether or not Cristina Neri and petitionerâs missing child are one and the same person.
Before the lower court, petitioner-appellee presented two physicians from the Sir John Clinic, namely, Dr. Carmen Ty and Dr. Angelina Trono to identify the child in question. But both witnesses could not positively declare that Cristina Neri is the same missing child Arabella Sombong of petitioner. Dr. Trono even declared in court that there were other babies left in the clinic and that she could not be certain which baby was given to respondents (pp. 48-49, tsn, Nov. 10, 1992). x x x Petitioner, herself, could not identify her own child, prompting the respondent court to call for child Cristina Neri to come forward near the bench for comparison of her physical features with that of her alleged mother, the petitioner (p. 32, tsn, Nov. 5, 1992). After a comparison of petitioner and Cristina Neriâs physical features, the lower court found no similarity and to which petitioner agreed claiming that said child looked like her sister-in-law (p. 33, id.) When the lower court instructed petitioner to bring said sister-in-law in the next hearing, petitioner stated they were not on good terms (p. 34, id.) No one, therefore, up to this time has come forward to testify as a witness in order to positively identify respondentsâ child Cristina Neri to be one and the same as petitionerâs missing child, Arabella Sombong.
xxx xxx xxx
The issuance of a writ of habeas corpus does not lie in this case considering that petitioner is not entitled to the custody of Cristina Neri because she is not the mother of the said child, and does not have the right to have custody over said child.
xxx xxx xxx
We do not agree with the lower court that the ground of abandonment of a child has been repealed by Art. 231 of the Family Code for abandonment can also be included under the phrase âcases which have resulted from culpable negligence of the parentâ (par. 2, Art. 231 of the Family Code). What can be the worst culpable negligence of a parent than abandoning her own child. This court does not believe petitioner-appelleeâs explanation that she had been negotiating for the discharge of her child for the past five years. That was too long a time for negotiation when she could have filed immediately a complaint with the authorities or the courts x x x
As to the issue of the welfare of the child, petitioner-appelleeâs capability to give her child the basic needs and guidance in life appear (sic) to be bleak. Before the lower court petitioner-appellee filed a motion to litigate as pauper as she had no fixed income. She also admitted that she had no stable job, and she had been separated from a man previously married to another woman. She also confessed that she planned to go abroad and leave her other child Johannes to the care of the nuns. The child Arabella Sombong wherever she is certainly does not face a bright prospect with petitioner-appellee.""
[13]
This prompted the petitioner to file this petition.
We do not find the petition to be meritorious.
While we sympathize with the plight of petitioner who has been separated from her daughter for more than eight years, we cannot grant her the relief she is seeking, because the evidence in this case does not support a finding that the child, Cristina, is in truth and in fact her child, Arabella; neither is there sufficient evidence to support the finding that private respondentsâ custody of Cristina is so illegal as to warrant the grant of a Writ of Habeas Corpus. In general, the purpose of the writ of habeas corpus is to determine whether or not a particular person is legally held. A prime specification of an application for a writ of habeas corpus, in fact, is an actual and effective, and not merely nominal or moral, illegal restraint of liberty. ""The writ of habeas corpus was devised and exists as a speedy and effectual remedy to relieve persons from unlawful restraint, and as the best and only sufficient defense of personal freedom. A prime specification of an application for a writ of habeas corpus is restraint of liberty. The essential object and purpose of the writ of habeas corpus is to inquire into all manner of involuntary restraint as distinguished from voluntary, and to relieve a person therefrom if such restraint is illegal. Any restraint which will preclude freedom of action is sufficient.
[14]
Fundamentally, in order to justify the grant of the writ of habeas corpus, the restraint of liberty must be in the nature of an illegal and involuntary deprivation of freedom of action. This is the basic requisite under the first part of Section 1, Rule 102, of the Revised Rules of Court, which provides that ""except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the writ of habeas corpus shall extend to all cases of illegal confinement or detention by which any person is deprived of his liberty.""
In the second part of the same provision, however, Habeas Corpus may be resorted to in cases where ""the rightful custody of any person is withheld from the person entitled thereto."" Thus, although the Writ of Habeas Corpus ought not to be issued if the restraint is voluntary, we have held time and again that the said writ is the proper legal remedy to enable parents to regain the custody of a minor child even if the latter be in the custody of a third person of her own free will.
[15]
It may even be said that in custody cases involving minors, the question of illegal and involuntary restraint of liberty is not the underlying rationale for the availability of the writ as a remedy; rather, the writ of habeas corpus is prosecuted for the purpose of determining the right of custody over a child.
The controversy does not involve the question of personal freedom, because an infant is presumed to be in the custody of someone until he attains majority age. In passing on the writ in a child custody case, the court deals with a matter of an equitable nature. Not bound by any mere legal right of parent or guardian, the court gives his or her claim to the custody of the child due weight as a claim founded on human nature and considered generally equitable and just. Therefore, these cases are decided, not on the legal right of the petitioner to be relieved from unlawful imprisonment or detention, as in the case of adults, but on the courtâs view of the best interests of those whose welfare requires that they be in custody of one person or another. Hence, the court is not bound to deliver a child into the custody of any claimant or of any person, but should, in the consideration of the facts, leave it in such custody as its welfare at the time appears to require. In short, the childâs welfare is the supreme consideration.
Considering that the childâs welfare is an all-important factor in custody cases, the Child and Youth Welfare Code16 unequivocally provides that in all questions regarding the care and custody, among others, of the child, his welfare shall be the paramount consideration.
[17]
In the same vein, the Family Code authorizes the courts to, if the welfare of the child so demands, deprive the parents concerned of parental authority over the child or adopt such measures as may be proper under the circumstances.
[18]
The foregoing principles considered, the grant of the writ in the instant case will all depend on the concurrence of the following requisites: (1) that the petitioner has the right of custody over the minor; (2) that the rightful custody of the minor is being withheld from the petitioner by the respondent; and (3) that it is to the best interest of the minor concerned to be in the custody of petitioner and not that of the respondent.
Not all of these requisites exist in this case. The dismissal of this petition is thus warranted.
I
As to the question
of identity.
Petitioner does not have the right of custody over the minor Cristina because, by the evidence disclosed before the court a quo, Cristina has not been shown to be petitionerâs daughter, Arabella. The evidence adduced before the trial court does not warrant the conclusion that Arabella is the same person as Cristina. It will be remembered that, in habeas corpus proceedings, the question of identity is relevant and material, subject to the usual presumptions including those as to identity of person.19 These presumptions may yield, however, to the evidence proffered by the parties.
""Identity may be thought of as a quality of a person or thing, - the quality of sameness with another person or thing. The essential assumption is that two persons or things are first thought of as existing, and that then the one is alleged, because of common features, to be the same as the other.""
[20]
Evidence must necessarily be adduced to prove that two persons, initially thought of to be distinct and separate from each other, are indeed one and the same. The process is both logical and analytical.
""x x x it operates by comparing common marks found to exist in the two supposed separate objects of thought, with reference to the possibility of their being the same. It follows that its force depends on the necessariness of the association between the mark and a single object. Where a certain circumstance, feature, or mark, may commonly be found associated with a large number of objects, the presence of that feature or mark in two supposed objects is little indication of their identity, because x x x the other conceivable hypotheses are so numerous, i.e., the objects that possess that mark are numerous and therefore any two of them possessing it may well be different. But where the objects possessing the mark are only one or a few, and the mark is found in two supposed instances, the chances of two being different are ânilâ or are comparatively small.
Hence, in the process of identification of two supposed objects, by a common mark, the force of the inference depends on the degree of necessariness of association of that mark with a single object.
For simplicityâs sake, the evidential circumstance may thus be spoken of as âa mark.â But in practice it rarely occurs that the evidential mark is a single circumstance. The evidencing feature is usually a group of circumstances, which as a whole constitute a feature capable of being associated with a single object. Rarely can one circumstance alone be so inherently peculiar to a single object. It is by adding circumstance to circumstance that we obtain a composite feature or mark which as a whole cannot be supposed to be associated with more than a single object.
The process of constructing an inference of identity thus consists usually in adding together a number of circumstances, each of which by itself might be a feature of many objects, but all of which together make it more probable that they co-exist in a single object only. Each additional circumstance reduces the chances of there being more than one object so associated.""
[21]
In the instant case, the testimonial and circumstantial proof establishes the individual and separate existence of petitionerâs child, Arabella, from that of private respondentsâ foster child, Cristina.
We note, among others, that Dr. Trono, who is petitionerâs own witness, testified in court that, together with Arabella, there were several babies left in the clinic and so she could not be certain whether it was Arabella or some other baby that was given to private respondents. Petitionerâs own evidence shows that, after the confinement of Arabella in the clinic in 1987, she saw her daughter again only in 1989 when she visited the clinic. This corroborates the testimony of petitionerâs own witness, Dra. Ty, that Arabella was physically confined in the clinic from November, 1987 to April, 1989. This testimony tallies with her assertion in her counter-affidavit to the effect that Arabella was in the custody of the hospital until April, 1989. All this, when juxtaposed with the unwavering declaration of private respondents that they obtained custody of Cristina in April, 1988 and had her baptized at the Good Samaritan Church on April 30, 1988, leads to the conclusion that Cristina is not Arabella.
Significantly, Justice. Lourdes K. Tayao-Jaguros, herself a mother and the ponente of the herein assailed decision, set the case for hearing on August 30, 1993 primarily for the purpose of observing petitionerâs demeanor towards the minor Cristina. She made the following personal but relevant manifestation:
""The undersigned ponente as a mother herself of four children, wanted to see how petitioner as an alleged mother of a missing child supposedly in the person of Cristina Neri would react on seeing again her long lost child. The petitioner appeared in the scheduled hearing of this case late, and she walked inside the courtroom looking for a seat without even stopping at her alleged daughterâs seat; without even casting a glance on said child, and without even that tearful embrace which characterizes the reunion of a loving mother with her missing dear child. Throughout the proceedings, the undersigned ponente noticed no signs of endearment and affection expected of a mother who had been deprived of the embrace of her little child for many years. The conclusion or finding of undersigned ponente as a mother, herself, that petitioner-appellee is not the mother of Cristina Neri has been given support by aforestated observation x x x.""
[22]
The process of constructing an inference of identity having earlier been explained to consist of adding one circumstance to another in order to obtain a composite feature or mark which as a whole cannot be supposed to be associated with more than a single object, the reverse is also true, i.e., when one circumstance is added to another, and the result is a fortification of the corporeality of. each of the two objects the identity of which is being sought to be established, the nexus of circumstances correspondingly multiply the chances of there being more than one object so associated. This is the situation that confronts us in this case, and so the inevitable but sad conclusion that we must make is that petitioner has no right of custody over the minor Cristina, because Cristina is not identical with her missing daughter, Arabella.
II
Private respondents
not unlawfully
withholding custody.
Since we hold that petitioner has not been established by evidence to be entitled to the custody of the minor Cristina on account of mistaken identity, it cannot be said that private respondents are unlawfully withholding from petitioner the rightful custody over Cristina. At this juncture, we need not inquire into the validity of the mode by which private respondents acquired custodial rights over the minor, Cristina. This matter is not ripe for adjudication in this instant petition for habeas corpus.
III
Private respondents
have the interest of
the child Cristina at heart.
We find that private respondents are financially, physically and spiritually in a better position to take care of the child, Cristina. They have the best interest of Cristina at heart. On the other hand, it is not to the best interest of the minor, Cristina, to be placed in the custody of petitioner, had the petitionerâs custody rights over Cristina been established. The Court of Appeals gave the reason:
""As to the issue of the welfare of the child, petitioner-appelleeâs capability to give her child the basic needs and guidance in life appear (sic) to be bleak. Before the lower court petitioner-appellee filed a motion to litigate as pauper as she had no fixed income. She also admitted that she had no stable job, and she had been separated from a man previously married to another woman. She also confessed that she planned to go abroad and leave her other child Johannes to the care of the nuns. The child Arabella Sombong wherever she is certainly does not face a bright prospect with petitioner-appellee.""
[23]
In the light of the aforegoing premises, we are constrained to rule that Habeas Corpus does not lie to afford petitioner the relief she seeks.
WHEREFORE,
the appealed decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 30574 is
AFFIRMED

THIRD DIVISION
[ G.R. No. 112034, January 31, 1996 ]
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. RIZALDY CONDE Y CORTEZ, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N
DAVIDE, JR., J.:
AAA was allegedly raped by accused-appellant Rizaldy Conde y Cortez
[1]
in the early morning of 31 October 1990. She reported the incident to the police authorities on that same day and then signed and swore to a complaint
[2]
for rape against the appellant before an Assistant City Prosecutor of xxx. The complaint was filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of xxx on 2 November 1990, docketed as Criminal Case No. C-36045, and assigned to Branch 124 of the said court. The accusatory portion of the complaint reads as follows:
That on or about the 31st day of October 1990 in xxx. and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie and have sexual intercourse with one AAA, against the latterâs will and without her consent.
[3]
Trial on the merits ensued after the appellant entered a plea of innocence upon his arraignment.
[4]
On 17 June 1992, the trial court rendered a decision
[5]
finding the appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape and sentencing him to suffer an imprisonment penalty of
reclusion perpetua;
to indemnify the victim, AAA, in the amount of P20,000.00; and to pay the costs.
[6]
The evidence for the prosecution upon which the judgment of conviction is based is summarized by the trial court as follows:
At about 1:00 oâclock in the early morning of October 31, 1990, AAA, a 38 year old housewife was sleeping on a bed at the ground floor of her house located at xxx. As she was sleeping, AAA felt something hard penetrating her private organ. She suddenly woke up and found a man on top of her. She shouted at the man, âSino ka?â The man whom she recognized but never saw before this incident, stood up and hurriedly put on his shorts and tried to flee from the house. AAA then put on her panty, which she wore when she slept the night before and which panty she found beside her on the bed, in order to run after the man. Just as the man was leaving the house by the front door, he was met by BBB, the sister of AAA, the two daughters of AAA named CCC and DDD and EEE, a male friend of CCC and DDD. The accused, in going out of the door managed to touch the thigh of CCC. At this point, EEE confronted the man and the two fought each other. CCC, DDD and BBB shouted  for help. Several neighbors responded and assisted in apprehending the man who identified himself as Rizaldy Conde. The neighbors as well as her two daughters and EEE brought the accused to the house of Barangay Councilman Ben Silverio who was living nearby. Later on, Councilman Silverio brought the accused to the Police Station accompanied by AAA and her two daughters as well as EEE. On their way to the Police Station, the accused threatened to rape AAA again and the latterâs two daughters once he was released.
Upon arrival at the xxx Police Station, the case was investigated by Corporal Alberto David. AAA executed a sworn statement on this case at about 2:40 A.M. of the same day - October 31, 1990 (Exh.âAâ). She had herself physically examined at the NBI Medico-Legal Office in the afternoon of October 31, 1990.
[7]
The testimony of the private complainant was corroborated by her daughter, CCC,
[8]
who likewise executed a sworn statement on 31 October 1990.
[9]
Dr. Bienvenido MuÃ±oz, the Medico-Legal Officer of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) who physically examined the private complainant, made the following findings and conclusions:
GENITAL EXAMINATION:
Pubic hair, fully grown, abundant. Labia majora and labia minora, both gaping. Fourchette, lax. Vestibule, pinkish. Hymen, reduced to carunculae myrtiformis. Vaginal orifice, admits a tube, 3.5 cm. in diameter. Vaginal walls, lax. Rugosities, obliterated.
CONCLUSIONS:
1.  No evident sign of extragenital physical injuries noted on the body of the subject at the time of examination.
2.  Vaginal orifice wide (3.5 cm. in diameter) as to allow complete penetration by an average-sized, adult male organ in full erection without producing new hymenal injury.
[10]
He further testified that it is possible for a woman to be raped while asleep and that if she has experienced childbirth several times, she may be raped even without being awakened.
[11]
The appellant, the lone witness for the defense, denied the charge of rape. He claimed that the night before the incident in question he had a drinking session with his brother and cousin at his home at xxx. He became too drunk that his brother had to hail a passenger jeepney for him to report to his employer, Major Edilberto Santos, Chief of the xxx Police Station. During the ride, he lost consciousness and could no longer recall what transpired thereafter.
[12]
He only regained consciousness when he was being mauled by several persons in front of the house of the private complainant. The latter accosted and asked him what he was doing in front of her house. He apologized, but instead the private complainant struck a lighted cigarette on his face. He was eventually brought to the police station. There, he learned that he was being accused of raping the private complainant. He then requested that he be allowed to seek the help of his employer but to no avail.
[13]
The appellant admitted that he had no idea why the private complainant whom he never met before would contrive the charge of rape. He surmised that his close association with his employer could be the source of envy of the investigating officer, P/Cpl. Alberto David, who happened to be a neighbor of the private complainant.
[14]
The trial court rejected the version of the appellant noting that he had admitted to having been arrested while he was outside the residence of the victim in the early morning of 31 October 1990. It gave weight to the testimony of the private complainant and concluded that the fact that she immediately pushed the appellant upon waking up, tried to run after him, immediately reported the incident to the police authorities, and lost no time in having herself physically examined at the NBI Medico-Legal Office indicate her sincerity and enhance her credibility.
[15]
In this appeal, the appellant imputes upon the trial court the following errors:
1.  IN FINDING THAT THERE WAS RAPE IN THE INSTANT CASE;
2.  IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE PROSECUTION EVIDENCE PARTICULARLY THE TESTIMONIES OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT AAA AND CCC;
3.  IN FINDING THAT THE EVIDENCE FOR THE PROSECUTION HAD ESTABLISHED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT THE GUILT OF APPELLANT FOR THE CRIME OF RAPE.
[16]
The appellant asserts that the medico-legal findings negate the alleged rape in that nothing therein shows that there were manifestations of recent sexual intercourse or any indication that the private complainant suffered extragenital physical injuries. Considering that she has been separated from her husband since 1985 and, according to her, she never had any sexual intercourse with any man thereafter, it was improbable for her not to have been awakened when the appellant was on top of her or not to have sustained any injury after having fought and pushed the appellant while the latterâs organ was in her private organ. Moreover, if indeed she was waiting for the arrival of her children, then she could not have been in deep sleep as she so alleged.
The appellant also points out inconsistencies between the testimonies in court and the sworn statements of the private complainant and her daughter CCC. For one, in their testimonies in court, they declared that when the appellant met CCC at the door while he was escaping, he stopped and mashed CCCâs body from the chest downwards to the thigh - that fact was not mentioned in their sworn statements. For another, CCC testified that when she was mashed by the appellant she parried his hand and shouted, and then she, her sister DDD, her aunt BBB, and EEE pursued him; in her affidavit, however, she stated that while she, DDD, BBB, and EEE were walking along the alley leading to their house they were surprised to see a person hurriedly leaving their house and that EEE then blocked the manâs path and boxed him.
Finally, the appellant submits that the testimony of the AAA and CCC that while they were on their way to the police station he threatened to kill and rape the private complainant and her daughter is incredible because after he was mauled, it would be âpreposterous and highly contrary to human behavior and experienceâ that he âwould still have the guts to threaten private complainant and her family.â
In the Brief for the Appellee, the Office of the Solicitor General submits that the trial court committed no error in finding the appellant guilty beyond peradventure of doubt of the crime of rape but recommends that the indemnity be increased from P20,000.00 to P50,000.00 conformably with the present policy of this Court.
The common denominator of the assigned errors is the credibility of the principal prosecution witnesses. One of the highly revered dicta Philippine jurisprudence has established is that this Court will not interfere with the judgment of the trial court in passing on the credibility of opposing witnesses unless there appears in the record some facts or circumstances of weight and influence which have been overlooked, which if considered would affect the result of the case. The reason therefor is founded on practical and empirical considerations. The trial judge is in a better position to decide the question of credibility, since he has personally heard the witnesses and observed their deportment and manner of testifying.
[17]
Our meticulous and dispassionate review of the evidence leads us to the conclusion that, except as to the amount of indemnity awarded to the private complainant, the trial court committed no error of fact or of law in its challenged decision.
The rape was consummated even before the private complainant was awakened. According to her, she was awakened at the time when something hard - the appellantâs penis - had penetrated her private organ. The entry or penetration was thus accomplished while she was still asleep. She may be considered to be unconscious then, for sleep is the ânatural usu. regular suspension of consciousness during which the powers of the body are restored,â
[18]
or âa natural or artificially induced state of suspension of sensory and motor activity.â
[19]
Under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman who is, inter alia, unconscious. The said Article provides in part as follows:
Art. 335.
When and how rape is committed.
- Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
xxx                                           xxx                                    xxx
2.       When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and x x x
This Court has held that carnal knowledge with a woman who is asleep constitutes rape.
[20]
We find undeserving of any consideration, for being purely speculative, the appellantâs contention of improbability or impossibility that the private complainant was unable to wake up before the penetration of a male organ into her private organ since she could not have been sound asleep for she was expecting her children to arrive home and that she has had no sexual contact since1985.
Neither is there any merit in his view that since the private complainant has had no sexual contact since 1985 it was unlikely that she would not suffer any injury in her private parts or any other part of her body. The absence of genital injury was satisfactorily explained by the medico-legal officer. The private complainant had already given birth to three children, and her hymenal opening is quite wide; thus, no new injury on her hymen could be caused by rape. The absence of any injury can also be explained by the fact that he did not retaliate when the private complainant pushed him upon waking up. The evidence disclose that when he was pushed by her he just stood up, hurriedly put on his shorts, and tried to flee. He did not put up a fight.
Nor are we persuaded by the appellantâs claim of inconsistencies between the testimonies and the sworn statements or affidavits of the private complainant and her daughter CCC. The claim is based on the erroneous theory that whenever a witness discloses in his testimony in court facts which he failed to state in his affidavit taken ante litem motam, then an inconsistency exists between the testimony and the affidavit. There can be an inconsistency if what the witness has disclosed in his affidavit is contrary to that he disclosed in his testimony in court, but not when what he has stated in open court are but details or additional facts not mentioned in the affidavit. Being taken ex-parte, affidavits are almost always incomplete and often inaccurate, sometimes from partial suggestion or for want of suggestions and inquiries, without the aid of which the witness may be unable to recall the connected collateral circumstances necessary for the correction of the first suggestion of his memory and for his accurate recollection of all that belongs to the subject. Their infirmity as a species of evidence is a matter of judicial experience. They are generally considered to be inferior to the testimony given in open court.
[21]
Besides, the witnesses were never confronted by the defense counsel on the alleged inconsistencies. Section 13, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court provides for the procedure of impeaching witnesses by evidence of inconsistent statements. It reads:
SEC. 13.
How witness impeached by evidence of inconsistent statements.
-
Before a witness can be impeached by evidence that he has made at other times statements inconsistent with his present testimony, the statements must be related to him, with the circumstances of the times and places and the persons present, and he must be asked whether he made such statements, and if so, allowed to explain them. If the statements be in writing they must be shown to the witness before any question is put to him concerning them.
Finally, even assuming that what the appellant had pointed out are indeed inconsistencies, they are on trivial or minor matters. It is settled that such inconsistencies do not impair the essential integrity of the prosecutionâs evidence as a whole or detract from the witnessesâ testimony; on the contrary, they even tend to strengthen rather than weaken the credibility of the prosecution witnesses because they erase the suspicion of a rehearsed testimony.
[22]
The appellantâs attack on the testimony of the prosecution witnesses regarding the threat he made while on their way to the police station is entirely irrelevant. In any event, his justification why he could not have made such threat fails to persuade.
We thus find futile all the attempts of the appellant to raise doubts on the testimonies of the private complainant and her daughter CCC. He has not even provided any improper motive why the said witnesses would falsely impute upon him the commission of rape. All that he could surmise is that P/Cpl. Alberto David, the police investigator who conducted the investigation in this case, is a neighbor of the private complainant. Yet, when asked on direct examination what that has to do with the filing of the charge of rape, the appellant merely answered that he did not know. Thus:
Q (ATTY. PACIS)
So if David is a neighbor of the complainant, what is the material connection of his being a neighbor to this fabricated charge according to you because you are denying this charge?
WITNESS (A)
I do not know, sir.
[23]
The absence of any improper motive on the part of the private complainant is further shown by other circumstances in this case. She did not know the appellant before the incident. After she woke up and came to know of the sexual assault, she immediately pushed the appellant and tried to run after him. She then reported the incident to the police authorities; executed a sworn statement; submitted herself to physical examination by a Medico-Legal Officer of the NBI; and subscribed and swore to a complaint for rape, which would necessarily result in her exposure to the ordeal of a public trial. The spontaneity of these acts clearly demonstrate her sincere desire to bring the appellant to justice.
The appellantâs defense of denial, which is inherently weak, cannot prevail over the clear and positive testimony of the private complainant.
[24]
We thus affirm the judgment of the trial court, subject to the modification of the indemnity. The award of P20,000.00 as civil indemnity to the private complainant is insufficient and is not in accord with the current policy of the Court.  It should be increased to P50,000.00 in the light of the attendant circumstances in this case.
WHEREFORE,
the instant appeal is DISMISSED and the challenged decision of Branch 124 of the Regional Trial Court of xxx in Criminal Case No. 0-36045 finding accused-appellant RIZALDY CONDE y CORTES guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape is hereby AFFIRMED, with modification on the award of civil indemnity to the private complainant, AAA, which is hereby increased from P20,000.00 to P50,000.00.

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ELISA MIRANDA Y DORIA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
R E S O L U T I O N
BELLOSILLO, J.:
Atty. Tomas P. Evangelista, counsel de parte for accused-appellant, in compliance with our resolution of 11 September 1995 explains that he failed to file the appellantâs brief within the prescribed period, which expired on 27 May 1995, because he assumed that he had already been relieved as counsel of the accused since her father never returned to confer with him and to furnish him with pertinent transcript of stenographic notes which he needed for the preparation of appellantâs brief.
We cannot accept the explanation. Counsel knew that he was required to file the brief on or before 27 May 1995. He could have easily sought an extension and cited his alleged difficulties with his client and/or her father, if that be the case. To merely assume that he had already been substituted readily shows his indifference to his professional responsibilities and utter lack of concern for the interest of his client who runs the risk of spending the greater part of her life in confinement.
It may be recalled that the Court earlier dismissed the instant appeal due to counselâs inaction although in a gesture of liberality and compassion for the accused it decided to reinstate the appeal and to give her another opportunity to show her innocence.
ACCORDINGLY,
the Court Resolves to
IMPOSE
on Atty. Tomas P. Evangelista a fine of P500.00 to be paid within five (5) days from notice hereof. Atty. Evangelista is warned that a repetition of the same or similar act will be dealt with more severely.
Let the copies of this resolution be furnished the Office of the Bar confidant and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.
SO ORDERED.

FIRST DIVISION
[ G.R. No. 102784, February 28, 1996 ]
ROSA LIM, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N
HERMOSISIMA, JR., J.:
This is a petition to review the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 10290, entitled ""People v. Rosa Lim,"" promulgated on August 30, 1991.
On January 26, 1989, an Information for Estafa was filed against petitioner Rosa Lim before Branch 92 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City.
[1]
The Information reads:
""That on or about the 8th day of October 1987, in Quezon City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused with intent to gain, with unfaithfulness and/or abuse of confidence, did, then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud one
VICTORIA SUAREZ,
in the following manner, to wit: on the date and place aforementioned said accused got and received in trust from said complainant one (1) ring 3.35 solo worth P169,000.00, Philippine Currency, with the obligation to sell the same on commission basis and to turn over the proceeds of the sale to said complainant or to return said jewelry if unsold, but the said accused once in possession thereof and far from complying with her obligation despite repeated demands therefor, misapplied, misappropriated and converted the same to her own personal use and benefit, to the damage and prejudice of the said offended party in the amount aforementioned and in such other amount as may be awarded under the provisions of the Civil Code.""
""
CONTRARY TO LAW.
""
[2]
After arraignment and trial on the merits, the trial court rendered judgment, the dispositive portion of which reads:
""
WHEREFORE,
in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered:
1. Finding accused Rosa Lim GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of estafa as defined and penalized under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code;
2. Sentencing her to suffer the Indeterminate penalty of FOUR (4) YEARS and TWO (2) MONTHS of prision correccional as minimum, to TEN (10) YEARS of prision mayor as maximum;
3. Ordering her to return to the offended party Mrs. Victoria Suarez the ring or its value in the amount of P169,000 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency; and
4. To pay costs.""
[3]
On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Judgment of conviction with the modification that the penalty imposed shall be six (6) years, eight (8) months and twenty- one (21) days to twenty (20) years in accordance with Article 315, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code.
[4]
Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration before the appellate court on September 20, 1991, but the motion was denied in a Resolution dated November 11, 1991.
In her final bid to exonerate herself, petitioner filed the instant petition for review alleging the following grounds:
I
THE RESPONDENT COURT VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTION, THE RULES OF COURT AND THE DECISION OF THIS HONORABLE COURT IN NOT PASSING UPON THE FIRST AND THIRD ASSIGNED ERRORS IN PETITIONERâS BRIEF;
II
THE RESPONDENT COURT FAILED TO APPLY THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE PAROL EVIDENCE RULE WAS WAIVED WHEN THE PRIVATE PROSECUTOR CROSS-EXAMINED THE PETITIONER AND AURELIA NADERA AND WHEN COMPLAINANT WAS CROSS-EXAMINED BY THE COUNSEL FOR THE PETITIONER AS TO THE TRUE NATURE OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES WHEREIN IT WAS DISCLOSED THAT THE TRUE AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES WAS A SALE OF JEWELRIES AND NOT WHAT WAS EMBODIED IN THE RECEIPT MARKED AS EXHIBIT ""A"" WHICH WAS RELIED UPON BY THE RESPONDENT COURT IN AFFIRMING THE JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION AGAINST HEREIN PETITIONER; and
III
THE RESPONDENT COURT FAILED TO APPLY IN THIS CASE THE PRINCIPLE ENUNCIATED BY THIS HONORABLE COURT TO THE EFFECT THAT ""ACCUSATION"" IS NOT, ACCORDING TO THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW, SYNONYMOUS WITH GUILT: THE PROSECUTION MUST OVERTHROW THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE WITH PROOF OF GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. TO MEET THIS STANDARD, THERE IS NEED FOR THE MOST CAREFUL SCRUTINY OF THE TESTIMONY OF THE STATE, BOTH ORAL AND DOCUMENTARY, INDEPENDENTLY OF WHATEVER DEFENSE IS OFFERED BY THE ACCUSED. ONLY IF THE JUDGE BELOW AND THE APPELLATE TRIBUNAL COULD ARRIVE AT A CONCLUSION THAT THE CRIME HAD BEEN COMMITTED PRECISELY BY THE PERSON ON TRIAL UNDER SUCH AN EXACTING TEST SHOULD SENTENCE THUS REQUIRED THAT EVERY INNOCENCE BE DULY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. THE PROOF AGAINST HIM MUST SURVIVE THE TEST OF REASON, THE STRONGEST SUSPICION MUST NOT BE PERMITTED TO SWAY JUDGMENT."" (People v. Austria, 195 SCRA 700)
[5]
Herein the pertinent facts as alleged by the prosecution.
On or about October 8, 1987, petitioner Rosa Lim who had come from Cebu received from private respondent Victoria Suarez the following two pieces of jewelry: one (1) 3.35 carat diamond ring worth P169,000.00 and one (1) bracelet worth P170,000.00, to be sold on commission basis. The agreement was reflected in a receipt marked as Exhibit ""A""
[6]
for the prosecution. The transaction took place at the Sir Williams Apartelle in Timog Avenue, Quezon City, where Rosa Lim was temporarily billeted.
On December 15, 1987, petitioner returned the bracelet to Vicky Suarez, but failed to return the diamond ring or to turn over the proceeds thereof if sold. As a result, private complainant, aside from making verbal demands, wrote a demand letter
[7]
to petitioner asking for the return of said ring or the proceeds of the sale thereof. In response, petitioner, thru counsel, wrote a letter
[8]
to private respondentâs counsel alleging that Rosa Lim had returned both ring and bracelet to Vicky Suarez sometime in September, 1987, for which reason, petitioner had no longer any liability to Mrs. Suarez insofar as the pieces of jewelry were concerned. Irked, Vicky Suarez filed a complaint for estafa under
Article 315, par. 1(b)
of the Revised Penal Code for which the petitioner herein stands convicted.
Petitioner has a different version.
Rosa Lim admitted in court that she arrived in Manila from Cebu sometime in October 1987, together with one Aurelia Nadera, who introduced petitioner to private respondent, and that they were lodged at the Williams Apartelle in Timog, Quezon City. Petitioner denied that the transaction was for her to sell the two pieces of jewelry on commission basis. She told Mrs. Suarez that she would consider buying the pieces of jewelry for her own use and that she would inform the private complainant of such decision before she goes back to Cebu. Thereafter, the petitioner took the pieces of jewelry and told Mrs. Suarez to prepare the ""necessary paper for me to sign because I was not yet prepare(d) to buy it.""
[9]
After the document was prepared, petitioner signed it. To prove that she did not agree to the terms of the receipt regarding the sale on commission basis, petitioner insists that she signed the aforesaid document on the upper portion thereof and not at the bottom where a space is provided for the signature of the person(s) receiving the jewelry.
[10]
On October 12, 1987 before departing for Cebu, petitioner called up Mrs. Suarez by telephone in order to inform her that she was no longer interested in the ring and bracelet. Mrs. Suarez replied that she was busy at the time and so, she instructed the petitioner to give the pieces of jewelry to Aurelia Nadera who would in turn give them back to the private complainant. The petitioner did as she was told and gave the two pieces of jewelry to Nadera as evidenced by a handwritten receipt, dated October 12, 1987.
[11]
Two issues need to be resolved: First, what was the real transaction between Rosa Lim and Vicky Suarez - a contract of agency to sell on commission basis as set out in the receipt or a sale on credit; and, second, was the subject diamond ring returned to Mrs. Suarez through Aurelia Nadera?
Petitioner maintains that she cannot be liable for estafa since she never received the jewelries in trust or on commission basis from Vicky Suarez. The real agreement between her and the private respondent was a sale on credit with Mrs. Suarez as the owner-seller and petitioner as the buyer, as indicated by the fact that petitioner did not sign on the blank space provided for the signature of the person receiving the jewelry but at the upper portion thereof immediately below the description of the items taken.
[12]
The contention is far from meritorious.
The receipt marked as Exhibit ""A"" which establishes a contract of agency to sell on commission basis between Vicky Suarez and Rosa Lim is herein reproduced in order to come to a proper perspective:
""

Rosa Limâs signature indeed appears on the upper portion of the receipt immediately below the description of the items taken. We find that this fact does not have the effect of altering the terms of the transaction from a contract of agency to sell on commission basis to a contract of sale. Neither does it indicate absence or vitiation of consent thereto on the part of Rosa Lim which would make the contract void or voidable. The moment she affixed her signature thereon, petitioner became bound by all the terms stipulated in the receipt. She, thus, opened herself to all the legal obligations that may arise from their breach. This is clear from Article 1356 of the New Civil Code which provides:
""Contracts shall be obligatory in whatever form they may have been entered into, provided all the essential requisites for their validity are present. x x x.""
However, there are some provisions of the law which require certain formalities for particular contracts. The first is when the form is required for the validity of the contract; the second is when it is required to make the contract effective as against third parties such as those mentioned in Articles 1357 and 1358; and the third is when the form is required for the purpose of proving the existence of the contract, such as those provided in the Statute of Frauds in Article 1403.
[13]
A contract of agency to sell on commission basis does not belong to any of these three categories, hence it is valid and enforceable in whatever form it may be entered into.
Furthermore, there is only one type of legal instrument where the law strictly prescribes the location of the signature of the parties thereto. This is in the case of notarial wills found in Article 805 of the Civil Code, to wit:
""Every will, other than a holographic will, must be subscribed at the
end
thereof by the testator himself x x x.
The testator or the person requested by him to write his name and the instrumental witnesses of the will, shall also sign, as aforesaid, each and every page thereof, except the last, on the
left margin
x x x.""
In the case before us, the parties did not execute a notarial will but a simple contract of agency to sell on commission basis, thus making the position of petitionerâs signature thereto immaterial.
Petitioner insists, however, that the diamond ring had been returned to Vicky Suarez through Aurelia Nadera, thus relieving her of any liability. Rosa Lim testified to this effect on direct examination by her counsel:
""Q:
And when she left the jewelries with you, what did you do thereafter?
A:
On October 12, I was bound for Cebu. So I called up Vicky through telephone and informed her that I am no longer interested in the bracelet and ring and that 1 will just return it.
Q:
And what was the reply of Vicky Suarez?
A:
She told me that she could not come to the apartelle since she was very busy. So, she asked me if Aurelia was there and when I informed her that Aurelia was there, she instructed me to give the pieces of jewelry to Aurelia who in turn will give it back to Vicky.
Q:
And you gave the two (2) pieces of jewelry to Aurelia Nadera?
A:
Yes, Your Honor.""
[14]
This was supported by Aurelia Nadera in her direct examination by petitionerâs counsel:
""Q:
Do you know if Rosa Lim in fact returned the jewelries ?
A:
She gave the jewelries to me.
Q:
Why did Rosa Lim give the jewelries to you?
A:
Rosa Lim called up Vicky Suarez the following morning and told Vicky Suarez that she was going home to Cebu and asked if she could give the jewelries to me.
Q:
And when did Rosa Lim give to you the jewelries?
A:
Before she left for Cebu.""
[15]
On rebuttal, these testimonies were belied by Vicky Suarez herself:
""Q:
It has been testified to here also by both Aurelia Nadera and Rosa Lim that you gave authorization to Rosa Lim to turn over the two (2) pieces of jewelries mentioned in Exhibit ""A"" to Aurelia Nadera, what can you say about that?
A:
That is not true sir, because at that time Aurelia Nadera is highly indebted to me in the amount of P 140,000.00, so if I gave it to Nadera, I will be exposing myself to a high risk.""
[16]
The issue as to the return of the ring boils down to one of credibility. Weight of evidence is not determined mathematically by the numerical superiority of the witnesses testifying to a given fact. It depends upon its practical effect in inducing belief on the part of the judge trying the case.
[17]
In the case at bench, both the trial court and the Court of Appeals gave weight to the testimony of Vicky Suarez that she did not authorize Rosa Lim to return the pieces of jewelry to Nadera. The respondent court, in affirming the trial court, said:
""x x x This claim (that the ring had been returned to Suarez thru Nadera) is disconcerting. It contravenes the very terms of Exhibit A. The instruction by the complaining witness to appellant to deliver the ring to Aurelia Nadera is vehemently denied by the complaining witness, who declared that she did not authorize and/or instruct appellant to do so. And thus, by delivering the ring to Aurelia without the express authority and consent of the complaining witness, appellant assumed the right to dispose of the jewelry as if it were hers, thereby committing conversion, a clear breach of trust, punishable under Article 315, par. 1(b), Revised Penal Code.""
We shall not disturb this finding of the respondent court. It is well settled that we should not interfere with the judgment of the trial court in determining the credibility of witnesses, unless there appears in the record some fact or circumstance of weight and influence which has been overlooked or the significance of which has been misinterpreted. The reason is that the trial court is in a better position to determine questions involving credibility having heard the witnesses and having observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial.[18]
Article 315, par. 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code provides:
""ART. 315. Swindling (estafa). - Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned hereinbelow shall be punished by:
xxx     xxx     xxx
(b) By misappropriating or converting, to the prejudice of another, money, goods, or any other personal property received by the offender in trust or on commission, or for administration, or under any other obligation involving the duty to make delivery of or to return the same, even though such obligation be totally or partially guaranteed by a bond; or by denying having received such money, goods, or other property.
xxx     xxx     xxx""
The elements of estafa with abuse of confidence under this subdivision are as follows: (1) That money, goods, or other personal property be received by the offender in trust, or on commission, or for administration, or under any other obligation involving the duty to make delivery of, or to return, the same; (2) That there be misappropriation or conversion of such money or property by the offender or denial on his part of such receipt; (3) That such misappropriation or conversion or denial is to the prejudice of another; and (4) That there is a demand made by the offended party to the offender (Note: The
4th
element is not necessary when there is evidence of misappropriation of the goods by the defendant).
[19]
All the elements of estafa under Article 315, Paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code, are present in the case at bench. First, the receipt marked as Exhibit ""A"" proves that petitioner Rosa Lim received the pieces of jewelry in trust from Vicky Suarez to be sold on commission basis. Second, petitioner misappropriated or converted the jewelry to her own use; and, third, such misappropriation obviously caused damage and prejudice to the private respondent.
WHEREFORE,
the petition is
DENIED
and the Decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby
AFFIRMED.

FIRST DIVISION
[ G.R. No. 108855, February 28, 1996 ]
METROLAB INDUSTRIES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. HONORABLE MA. NIEVES ROLDAN CONFESOR, IN HER CAPACITY AS SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT AND METRO DRUG CORPORATION EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION-FEDERATION OF FREE WORKERS, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N
KAPUNAN, J.:
This is a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court seeking the annulment of the Resolution and Omnibus Resolution of the Secretary of Labor and Employment dated 14 April 1992 and 25 January 1993, respectively, in OS-AJ-04491-11 (NCMB-NCR-NS-08-595-9 1; NCMB-NCR-NS-09-678-91) on grounds that these were issued with grave abuse of discretion and in excess of jurisdiction.
Private respondent Metro Drug Corporation Employees Association-Federation of Free Workers (hereinafter referred to as the Union) is a labor organization representing the rank and file employees of petitioner Metrolab Industries, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as Metrolab/MII) and also of Metro Drug, Inc.
On 31 December 1990, the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between Metrolab and the Union expired. The negotiations for a new CBA, however, ended in a deadlock.
Consequently, on 23 August 1991, the Union filed a notice of strike against Metrolab and Metro Drug Inc. The parties failed to settle their dispute despite the conciliation efforts of the National Conciliation and Mediation Board.
To contain the escalating dispute, the then Secretary of Labor and Employment, Ruben D. Torres, issued an assumption order dated 20 September 1991, the dispositive portion of which reads, thus:
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, and pursuant to Article 263 (g) of the Labor Code, as amended, this Office hereby
assumes jurisdiction over the entire labor dispute at Metro Drug, Inc. - Metro Drug Distribution Division and Metrolab Industries Inc.
Accordingly, any strike or lockout is hereby strictly enjoined. The Companies and the Metro Drug Corp. Employees Association - FFW are likewise directed to cease and desist from committing any and all acts that might exacerbate the situation.
Finally, the parties are directed to submit their position papers and evidence on the aforequoted deadlocked issues to this office within twenty (20) days from receipt hereof.
SO ORDERED.
[1]
(Italics ours.)
On 27 December 1991, then Labor Secretary Torres issued an order resolving all the disputed items in the CBA and ordered the parties involved to execute a new CBA.
Thereafter, the Union filed a motion for reconsideration.
On 27 January 1992, during the pendency of the abovementioned motion for reconsideration, Metrolab laid off 94 of its rank and file employees.
On the same date, the Union filed a motion for a cease and desist order to enjoin Metrolab from implementing the mass layoff, alleging that such act violated the prohibition against committing acts that would exacerbate the dispute as specifically directed in the assumption order.
[2]
On the other hand, Metrolab contended that the layoff was temporary and in the exercise of its management prerogative. It maintained that the company would suffer a yearly gross revenue loss of approximately sixty-six (66) million pesos due to the withdrawal of its principals in the Toll and Contract Manufacturing Department. Metrolab further asserted that with the automation of the manufacture of its product ""Eskinol,"" the number of workers required its production is significantly reduced.
[3]
Thereafter, on various dates, Metrolab recalled some of the laid off workers on a temporary basis due to availability of work in the production lines.
On 14 April 1992, Acting Labor Secretary Nieves Confesor issued a resolution declaring the layoff of Metrolabâs 94 rank and file workers illegal and ordered their reinstatement with full backwages. The dispositive portion reads as follows:
WHEREFORE, the Unionâs motion for reconsideration is granted in part, and our order of 28 December 1991 is affirmed subject to the modifications in allowances and in the close shop provision. The layoff of the 94 employees at MII is hereby declared illegal for the failure of the latter to comply with our injunction against committing any act which may exacerbate the dispute and with the 30-day notice requirement. Accordingly, MII is hereby ordered to reinstate the 94 employees, except those who have already been recalled, to their former positions or substantially equivalent, positions with full backwages from the date they were illegally laid off on 27 January 1992 until actually reinstated without loss of seniority rights and other benefits. Issues relative to the CBA agreed upon by the parties and not embodied in our earlier order are hereby ordered adopted for incorporation in the CBA. Further, the dispositions and directives contained in all previous orders and resolutions relative to the instant dispute, insofar as not inconsistent herein, are reiterated. Finally, the parties are enjoined to cease and desist from committing any act which may tend to circumvent this resolution.
SO RESOLVED.
[4]
On 6 March 1992, Metrolab filed a Partial Motion for Reconsideration alleging that the layoff did not aggravate the dispute since no untoward incident occurred as a result thereof. It, likewise, filed a motion for clarification regarding the constitution of the bargaining unit covered by the CBA.
On 29 June 1992, after exhaustive negotiations, the parties entered into a new CBA. The execution, however, was without prejudice to the outcome of the issues raised in the reconsideration and clarification motions submitted for decision to the Secretary of Labor.
[5]
Pending the resolution of the aforestated motions, on 2 October 1992, Metrolab laid off 73 of its employees on grounds of redundancy due to lack of work which the Union again promptly opposed on 5 October 1992.
On 15 October 1992, Labor Secretary Confesor again issued a cease and desist order. Metrolab moved for a reconsideration.
[6]
On 25 January 1993, Labor Secretary Confesor issued the assailed Omnibus Resolution containing the following orders:
xxx   xxx   xxx.
1. MIIâs motion for partial reconsideration of our 14 April 1992 resolution specifically that portion thereof assailing our ruling that the layoff of the 94 employees is illegal, is hereby denied. MII is hereby ordered to pay such employees their full backwages computed from the time of actual layoff to the time of actual recall;
2. For the parties to incorporate in their respective collective bargaining agreements the clarifications herein contained; and
3. MIIâs motion for reconsideration with respect to the consequences of the second wave of layoff affecting 73 employees, to the extent of assailing our ruling that such layoff tended to exacerbate the dispute, is hereby denied. But inasmuch as the legality of the layoff was not submitted for our resolution and no evidence had been adduced upon which a categorical finding thereon can be based, the same is hereby referred to the NLRC for its appropriate action.
Finally, all prohibitory injunctions issued as a result of our assumption of jurisdiction over this dispute are hereby lifted.
SO RESOLVED.
[7]
Labor Secretary Confesor also ruled that executive secretaries are excluded from the closed-shop provision of the CBA, not from the bargaining unit.
On 4 February 1993, the Union filed a motion for execution. Metrolab opposed. Hence, the present petition for certiorari with application for issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order.
On 4 March 1993, we issued a Temporary Restraining Order enjoining the Secretary of Labor from enforcing and implementing the assailed Resolution and Omnibus Resolution dated 14 April 1992 and 25 January 1993, respectively.
In its petition, Metrolab assigns the following errors:
A
THE PUBLIC RESPONDENT HON. SECRETARY OF LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AND EXCEEDED HER JURISDICTION IN DECLARING THE TEMPORARY LAYOFF ILLEGAL AND ORDERING THE REINSTATEMENT AND PAYMENT OF BACKWAGES TO THE AFFECTED EMPLOYEES.
[*]
B
THE PUBLIC RESPONDENT HON. SECRETARY OF LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT GRAVELY ABUSED HER DISCRETION IN INCLUDING EXECUTIVE SECRETARIES AS PART OF THE BARGAINING UNIT OF RANK AND FILE EMPLOYEES.
[8]
Anent the first issue, we are asked to determine whether or not public respondent Labor Secretary committed grave abuse of discretion and exceeded her jurisdiction in declaring the subject layoffs instituted by Metrolab illegal on grounds that these unilateral actions aggravated the conflict between Metrolab and the Union who were, then, locked in a stalemate in CBA negotiations.
Metrolab argues that the Labor Secretaryâs order enjoining the parties from committing any act that might exacerbate the dispute is overly broad, sweeping and vague and should not be used to curtail the employerâs right to manage his business and ensure its viability.
We cannot give credence to Metrolabâs contention.
This Court recognizes the exercise of management prerogatives and often declines to interfere with the legitimate business decisions of the employer. However, this privilege is not absolute but subject to limitations imposed by law.
[9]
In
PAL v. NLRC,
[10]
we issued this reminder:
xxx      xxx      xxx
. . .the exercise of management prerogatives was never considered boundless. Thus, in
Cruz vs. Medina
( 177 SCRA 565 [1989]), it was held that managementâs prerogatives must be without abuse of discretion....
xxx     xxx      xxx
All this points to the conclusion that the exercise of managerial prerogatives is not unlimited. It is circumscribed by limitations found in law, a collective bargaining agreement, or the general principles of fair play and justice
(University of Sto. Tomas v. NLRC, 190 SCRA 758 [1990]). . . . (Italics ours.)

The case at bench constitutes one of the exceptions. The Secretary of Labor is expressly given the power under the Labor Code to assume jurisdiction and resolve labor disputes involving industries indispensable to national interest. The disputed injunction is subsumed under this special grant of authority. Art. 263 (g) of the Labor Code specifically provides that:
xxx    xxx    xxx
(g) When, in his opinion, there exists a labor dispute causing or likely to cause a strike or lockout in an industry indispensable to the national interest, the Secretary of Labor and Employment may assume jurisdiction over the dispute and decide it or certify the same to the Commission for compulsory arbitration. Such assumption or certification shall have the effect of automatically enjoining the intended or impending strike or lockout as specified in the assumption or certification order. If one has already taken place at the time of assumption or certification, all striking or locked out employees shall immediately return to work and the employer shall immediately resume operations and readmit all workers under the same terms and conditions prevailing before the strike or lockout. The Secretary of Labor and Employment or the Commission may seek the assistance of law enforcement agencies to ensure compliance with this provision
as well as with such orders as he may issue to enforce the same.
. . (Italics ours.)
xxx    xxx    xxx.
That Metrolabâs business is of national interest is not disputed. Metrolab is one of the leading manufacturers and suppliers of medical and pharmaceutical products to the country.
Metro labâs management prerogatives, therefore, are not being unjustly curtailed but duly balanced with and tempered by the limitations set by law, taking into account its special character and the particular circumstances in the case at bench.
As aptly declared by public respondent Secretary of Labor in its assailed resolution:
xxx    xxx     xxx.
MII is right to the extent that as a rule, we may not interfere with the legitimate exercise of management prerogatives such as layoffs. But it may nevertheless be appropriate to mention here that one of the substantive evils which Article 263 (g) of the Labor Code seeks to curb is the exacerbation of a labor dispute to the further detriment of the national interest. When a labor dispute has in fact occurred and a general injunction has been issued restraining the commission of disruptive acts, management prerogatives must always be exercised consistently with the statutory objective.
[11]
xxx    xxx    xxx.
Metrolab insists that the subject layoffs did not exacerbate their dispute with the Union since no untoward incident occurred after the layoffs were implemented. There were no work disruptions or stoppages and no mass actions were threatened or undertaken. Instead, petitioner asserts, the affected employees calmly accepted their fate ""as this was a matter which they had been previously advised would be inevitable.""
[12]
After a judicious review of the record, we find no compelling reason to overturn the findings of the Secretary of Labor.
We reaffirm the doctrine that considering their expertise in their respective fields, factual findings of administrative agencies supported by substantial evidence are accorded great respect and binds this Court.
[13]
The Secretary of Labor ruled, thus:
xxx    xxx    xxx.
Any act committed during the pendency of the dispute that tends to give rise to further contentious issues or increase the tensions between the parties should be considered an actâ of exacerbation. One must look at the act itself, not on speculative reactions. A misplaced recourse is not needed to prove that a dispute has been exacerbated. For instance, the Union could not be expected to file another notice of strike. For this would depart from its theory of the case that the layoff is subsumed under the instant dispute, for which a notice of strike had already been filed. On the other hand, to expect violent reactions, unruly behavior, and any other chaotic or drastic action from the Union is to expect it to commit acts disruptive of public order or acts that may be illegal. Under a regime of laws, legal remedies take the place of violent ones.
[14]
xxx    xxx    xxx.
Protest against the subject layoffs need not be in the form of violent action or any other drastic measure. In the instant case the Union registered their dissent by swiftly filing a motion for a cease and desist order. Contrary to petitionerâs allegations, the Union strongly condemned the layoffs and threatened mass action if the Secretary of Labor fails to timely intervene:
xxx    xxx     xxx.
3. This unilateral action of management is a blatant violation of the injunction of this Office against committing acts which would exacerbate the dispute. Unless such act is enjoined the Union will be compelled to resort to its legal right to mass actions and concerted activities to protest and stop the said management action. This mass layoff is clearly one which would result in a very serious labor dispute unless this Office swiftly intervenes.
[15]
xxx    xxx     xxx.
Metrolab and the Union were still in the process of resolving their CBA deadlock when petitioner implemented the subject layoffs. As a result, motions and oppositions were filed diverting the partiesâ attention, delaying resolution of the bargaining deadlock and postponing the signing of their new CBA, thereby aggravating the whole conflict.
We, likewise, find untenable Metrolabâs contention that the layoff of the 94 rank-and-file employees was temporary, despite the recall of some of the laid off workers.
If Metrolab intended the layoff of the 94 workers to be temporary, it should have plainly stated so in the notices it sent to the affected employees and the Department of Labor and Employment. Consider the tenor of the pertinent portions of the layoff notice to the affected employees:
xxx    xxx     xxx.
Dahil sa mga bagay na ito, napilitan ang ating kumpanya na magsagawa ng ""lay-off"" ng mga empleyado sa Rank & File dahil nabawasan ang trabaho at puwesto para sa kanila.
Marami sa atin ang kasama sa ""lay-off"" dahil wala nang trabaho para sa kanila.
Mahirap tanggapin ang mga bagay na ito subalit kailangan nating gawin dahil hindi kaya ng kumpanya ang magbayad ng suweldo kung ang empleyado ay walang trabaho. Kung tayo ay patuloy na magbabayad ng suweldo, mas hihina ang ating kumpanya at mas marami ang mÃ¡aaring maapektuhan.
Sa pagpapatupad ng ""lay-off"" susundin natin ang LAST IN-FIRST OUT policy. Ang mga empleyadong may pinakamaikling serbisyo sa kumpanya ang unang maaapektuhan. Ito ay batay na rin sa nakasaad sa ating CBA na ang mga huling pumasok sa kumpanya ang unang masasama sa ""lay-off"" kapag nagkaroon ng ganitong mga kalagayan.
Ang mga empleyado na kasama sa ""lay-off"" ay nakalista sa sulat na ito. Ang umpisa ng lay-off ay sa Lunes, Enero 27. Hindi na muna sila papasok sa kumpanya. Makukuha nila ang suweldo nila sa Enero 30, 1992.
Hindi po natin matitiyak kung gaano katagal ang ""lay-off"" ngunit ang aming tingin ay matatagalan bago magkaroon ng dagdag na trabaho. Dahil dito, sinimulan na namin ang isang ""Redundancy Program"" sa mga supervisors. Nabawasan ang mga puwesto para sa kanila, kaya sila ay mawawalan ng trabaho at bibigyan na ng redundancy pay.
[16]
(Italics ours.)
xxx     xxx     xxx.
We agree with the ruling of the Secretary of Labor, thus:
xxx     xxx     xxx.
. . .MII insists that the layoff in question is temporary not permanent. It then cites
International Hardware, Inc. vs. NLRC,
176 SCRA 256, in which the Supreme Court held that the 30-day notice required under Article 283 of the Labor Code need not be complied with if the employer has no intention to permanently severe (sic) the employment relationship.
We are not convinced by this argument.
International Hardware
involves a case where there had been a reduction of workload. Precisely to avoid laying off the employees, the employer therein opted to give them work on a rotating basis. Though on a limited scale, work was available. This was the Supreme Courtâs basis for holding that there was no intention to permanently severe (sic) the employment relationship.
Here, there is no circumstance at all from which we can infer an intention from MII not to sever the employment relationship permanently. If there was such an intention, MII could have made it very clear in the notices of layoff. But as it were, the notices are couched in a language so uncertain that the only conclusion possible is the permanent termination, not the continuation, of the employment relationship.
MII also seeks to excuse itself from compliance with the 30-day notice with a tautology. While insisting that there is really no best time to announce a bad news, (sic) it also claims that it broke the bad news only on 27 January 1992 because had it complied with the 30-day notice, it could have broken the bad news on 02 January 1992, the first working day of the year. If there is really no best time to announce a bad news (sic), it wouldnât have mattered if the same was announced at the first working day of the year. That way, MII could have at least complied with the requirement of the law.
[17]
The second issue raised by petitioner merits our consideration.
In the assailed Omnibus Resolution, Labor Secretary Confesor clarified the CBA provisions on closed-shop and the scope of the bargaining unit in this wise:
xxx     xxx     xxx.
Appropriateness of the bargaining unit.
xxx     xxx     xxx.
Exclusions. In our 14 April 1992 resolution, we ruled on the issue of exclusion as follows:
These aside, we reconsider our denial of the modifications which the Union proposes to introduce on the close shop provision. While we note that the provision as presently worded has servedâ the relationship of the parties well under previous CBAâs, the shift in constitutional policy toward expanding the right of all workers to self-organization should now be formally recognized by the parties, subject to the following exclusions only:
1. Managerial employees; and
2. The executive secretaries of the President, Executive Vice-President, Vice-President, Vice President for Sales, Personnel Manager, and Director for Corporate Planning who may have access to vital labor relations information or who may otherwise act in a confidential capacity to persons who determine or formulate management policies.
The provisions of Article I (b) and Attachment I of the 1988-1990 CBA shall thus be modified consistently with the foregoing.
Article I (b) of the 1988-1990 CBA provides:
b)Close Shop. - All Qualified Employees must join the Association immediately upon regularization as a condition for continued employment. This provision shall not apply to: (i) managerial employees who are excluded from the scope of the bargaining unit; (ii) the auditors and executive secretaries of senior executive officers, such as, the President, Executive Vice-President, Vice-President for Finance, Head of Legal, Vice-President for Sales, who are excluded from membership in the Association; and (iii) those employees who are referred to in Attachment I hereof, subject, however, to the application of the provision of Article II, par. (b) hereof. Consequently, the above-specified employees are not required to join the Association as a condition for their continued employment.
On the other hand, Attachment I provides:
Exclusion from the Scope of the Close Shop Provision
The following positions in the Bargaining Unit are not covered by the Close Shop provision of the CBA (Article I, par. b):
1. Executive Secretaries of Vice-Presidents, or equivalent positions.
2. Executive Secretary of the Personnel Manager, or equivalent positions.
3. Executive Secretary of the Director for Corporate Planning, or equivalent positions.
4. Some personnel in the Personnel Department, EDP Staff at Head Office, Payroll Staff at Head Office, Accounting Department at Head Office, and Budget Staff, who because of the nature of their duties and responsibilities need not join the Association as a condition for their employment.
5. Newly-hired secretaries of Branch Managers and Regional Managers.
Both MDD and MII read the exclusion of managerial employees and executive secretaries in our 14 April 1992 resolution as exclusion from the bargaining unit. They point out that managerial employees are lumped under one classification with executive secretaries, so that since the former are excluded from the bargaining unit, so must the latter be likewise excluded.
This reading is obviously contrary to the intent of our 14 April 1992 resolution. By recognizing the expanded scope of the right to self-organization, our intent was to delimit the types of employees excluded from the close shop provision, not from the bargaining unit, to executive secretaries only. Otherwise, the conversion of the exclusionary provision to one that refers to the bargaining unit from one that merely refers to the close shop provision would effectively curtail all the organizational rights of executive secretaries.
The exclusion of managerial employees, in accordance with law, must therefore still carry the qualifying phrase ""from the bargaining unit"" in Article I (b)(i) of the 1988-1990 CBA. In the same manner, the exclusion of executive secretaries should be read together with the qualifying phrase ""are excluded from membership in the Association"" of the same Article and with the heading of Attachment I. The latter refers to ""Exclusions from Scope of Close Shop Provision"" and provides that ""[t]he following positions in Bargaining Unit are not covered by the close shop provision of the CBA.""
The issue of exclusion has different dimension in the case of MII. In an earlier motion for clarification, MII points out that it has done away with the positions of Executive Vice-President, Vice-President for Sales, and Director for Corporate Planning. Thus, the foregoing group of exclusions is no longer appropriate in its present organizational structure. Nevertheless, there remain MII officer positions for which there may be executive secretaries. These include the General Manager and members of the Management Committee, specifically i) the Quality Assurance Manager; ii) the Product Development Manager; iii) the Finance Director; iv) the Management System Manager;â v) the Human Resources Manager; vi) the Marketing Director; vii) the Engineering Manager; viii) the Materials Manager; and ix) the Production Manager.
xxx    xxx    xxx
The basis for the questioned exclusions, it should be noted, is no other than the previous CBA between MII and the Union. If MII had undergone an organizational restructuring since then, this is a fact to which we have never been made privy. In any event, had this been otherwise the result would have been the same. To repeat, we limited the exclusions to recognize the expanded scope of the right to self-organization as embodied in the Constitution
.[18]
Metrolab, however, maintains that executive secretaries of the General Manager and the executive secretaries of the Quality Assurance Manager, Product Development Manager, Finance Director, Management System Manager, Human Resources Manager, Marketing Director, Engineering Manager, Materials Manager and Production Manager, who are all members of the companyâs Management Committee should not only be exempted from the closed-shop provision but should be excluded from membership in the bargaining unit of the rank and file employees as well on grounds that their executive secretaries are confidential employees, having access to ""vital labor information.""
[19]
We concur with Metrolab.
Although Article 245 of the Labor Code
[20]
limits the ineligibility to join, form and assist any labor organization to managerial employees, jurisprudence has extended this prohibition to confidential employees or those who by reason of their positions or nature of work are required to assist or act in a fiduciary manner to managerial employees and hence, are likewise privy to sensitive and highly confidential records.
The rationale behind the exclusion of confidential employees from the bargaining unit of the rank and file employees and their disqualification to join any labor organization was succinctly discussed in
Philips Industrial Development v. NLRC:
[21]
xxx    xxx    xxx.
On the main issue raised before Us, it is quite obvious that respondent NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in reversing the decision of the Executive Labor Arbiter and in decreeing that PIDIâs ""Service Engineers, Sales Force, division secretaries, all Staff of General Management, Personnel and Industrial Relations Department, Secretaries of Audit, EDP and Financial Systems are included within the rank and file bargaining unit.""
In the first place, all these employees, with the exception of the service engineers and the sales force personnel, are confidential employees. Their classification as such is not seriously disputed by PEO-FFW; the five (5) previous CBAs between PIDI and PEO-FFW explicitly considered them as confidential employees. By the very nature of their functions, they assist and act in a confidential capacity to, or have access to confidential matters of, persons who exercise managerial functions in the field of labor relations. As such, the rationale behind the ineligibility of managerial employees to form, assist or join a labor union equally applies to them.
In
Bulletin Publishing Co., Inc. vs. Hon. Augusto Sanchez,
this Court elaborated on this rationale, thus:
x x x The rationale for this inhibition has been stated to be, because if these managerial employees would belong to or be affiliated with a Union, the latter might not be assured of their loyalty to the Union in view of evident conflict of interests. The Union can also become company-dominated with the presence of managerial employees in Union membership.""
In Golden Farms, Inc. vs. Ferrer-Calleja, this Court explicitly made this rationale applicable to confidential employees:
This rationale holds true also for confidential employees such as accounting personnel, radio and telegraph operators, who having access to confidential information, may become the source of undue advantage. Said employee(s) may act as a spy or spies of either party to a collective bargaining agreement. This is specially true in the present case where the petitioning Union is already the bargaining agent of the rank-and-file employees in the establishment. To allow the confidential employees to join the existing Union of the rank-and-file would be in violation of the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement wherein this kind of employees by the nature of their functions/positions are expressly excluded.""
xxx    xxx    xxx.
Similarly, in
National Association of Trade Union - Republic Planters Bank Supervisors Chapter v. Torres
[22]
we declared:
xxx    xxx    xxx.
. . . As regards the other claim of respondent Bank that Branch Managers/OICs, Cashiers and Controllers are confidential employees, having control, custody and/ or access to confidential matters, e.g., the branchâs cash position, statements of financial condition, vault combination, cash codes for telegraphic transfers, demand drafts and other negotiable instruments, pursuant to Sec. 1166.4 of the Central Bank Manual regarding joint custody, this claim is not even disputed by petitioner. A confidential employee is one entrusted with confidence on delicate matters, or with the custody, handling, or care and protection of the employerâs property. While Art. 245 of the Labor Code singles out managerial employees as ineligible to join, assist or form any labor organization, under the doctrine of necessary, implication, confidential employees are similarly disqualified. . . .
xxx     xxx     xxx.
. . .(I)n the collective bargaining process, managerial employees are supposed to be on the side of the employer, to act as its representatives, and to see to it that its interest are well protected. The employer is not assured of such protection if these employees themselves are union members. Collective bargaining in such a situation can become one-sided. It is the same reason that impelled this Court to consider the position of confidential employees as included in the disqualification found in Art. 245 as if the disqualification of confidential employees were written in the provision. If confidential employees could unionize in order to bargain for advantages for themselves, then they could be governed by their own motives rather than the interest of the employers. Moreover, unionization of confidential employees for the purpose of collective bargaining would mean the extension of the law to persons or individuals who are supposed to act ""in the interest of the employers. It is not farfetched that in the course of collective bargaining, they might jeopardize that interest which they are duty-bound to protect. . . .
xxx     xxx     xxx.
And in the latest case of Pier 8 Arrastre & Stevedoring Services, Inc. vs. Roldan-Confesor,
[23]
we ruled that:
xxx     xxx    xxx.
Upon the other hand, legal secretaries are neither managers nor supervisors. Their work is basically routinary and clerical. However, they should be differentiated from rank-and-file employees because they are tasked with, among others, the typing of legal documents, memoranda and correspondence, the keeping of records and files, the giving of and receiving notices, and such other duties as required by the legal personnel of the corporation. Legal secretaries therefore fall under the category of confidential employees. . . .
xxx    xxx    xxx.
We thus hold that public respondent acted with grave abuse of discretion in not excluding the four foremen and legal secretary from the bargaining unit composed of rank-and-file employees.
xxx    xxx    xxx.
In the case at bench, the Union does not disagree with petitioner that the executive secretaries are confidential employees. It however, makes the following contentions:
xxx     xxx     xxx.
There would be no danger of company domination of the Union since the confidential employees would not be members of and would not participate in the decision making processes of the Union.
Neither would there be a danger of espionage since the confidential employees would not have any conflict of interest, not being members of the Union. In any case, there is always the danger that any employee would leak management secrets to the Union out of sympathy for his fellow rank and filer even if he were not a member of the union nor the bargaining unit.
Confidential employees are rank and file employees and they, like all the other rank and file employees, should be granted the benefits of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. There is no valid basis for discriminating against them. The mandate of the Constitution and the Labor Code, primarily of protection to Labor, compels such conclusion.
[24]
xxx    xxx    xxx.
The Unionâs assurances fail to convince. The dangers sought to be prevented, particularly the threat of conflict of interest and espionage, are not eliminated by non-membership of Metrolabâs executive secretaries or confidential employees in the Union. Forming part of the bargaining unit, the executive secretaries stand to benefit from any agreement executed between the Union and Metrolab. Such a scenario, thus, gives rise to a potential conflict between personal interests and their duty as confidential employees to act for and in behalf of Metrolab. They do not have to be union members to affect or influence either side.
Finally, confidential employees cannot be classified as rank and file. As previously discussed, the nature of employment of confidential employees is quite distinct from the rank and file, thus, warranting a separate category. Excluding confidential employees from the rank and file bargaining unit, therefore, is not tantamount to discrimination.
WHEREFORE,
premises considered, the petition is partially
GRANTED.
The resolutions of public respondent Secretary of Labor dated 14 April 1992 and 25 January 1993 are hereby
MODIFIED
to the extent that executive secretaries of petitioner Metrolabâs General Manager and the executive secretaries of the members of its Management Committee are excluded from the bargaining unit of petitionerâs rank and file employees.

Metrolab submits that the issue in the instant petition for certiorari is limited to the determination of whether or not the Secretary of Labor gravely abused her discretion in ruling that the layoff of its 94 workers exacerbated their labor dispute with the Union. Metrolab underscores that the basis for the said layoff ""has never been placed in issue."" (Rollo, pp. 327- 328.)
In the same manner, Metrolab prefatorily declared that it does not dispute the Secretary of Laborâs certification to the NLRC of the legality (or illegality) of the second layoff of Metrolabâs 73 rank and file workers on grounds of redundancy (Rollo, pp. 11-12). In its Consolidated Reply, Metrolab states, thus:
5.0. Moreover, the redundancy program of October 1992 is not an issue in the present petition. The assailed Omnibus Order, in no uncertain terms, ordered that this matter be brought before the National Labor Relations Commission (""NLRC"") for adjudication (Please see Annex ""A-i"" of the Petition). Petitioner herein does not question the said part of the Omnibus Resolution in the present petition. The time for the same is not yet ripe, as the NLRC still has to pass judgment upon the facts surrounding the redundancy program. As of this writing, the said redundancy program is presently being litigated before the Arbitration Branch of the NLRC in NLRC-NCR Case No. 00-05-03325-93 entitled ""Metro Drug Corporation Employees Association - FFW v.

THIRD DIVISION
[ G.R. No. 116727, February 27, 1996 ]
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. FELIX ESQUILA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N
MELO, J.:
Before us is the appeal of Felix Esquilla from the decision of Branch 21 of the Regional Trial Court of the 11th Judicial Region stationed in Bansalan, Davao del Sur, convicting him of the crime of rape and imposing on him the penalty of
reclusion perpetua,
and ordering him to indemnify the victim, Maribeth Esquilla, in the amount of P20,000.00 as moral damages.
Accused-appellant assails said judgment and ventilates his appeal on the general and catch-all argument that the court a quo erred in convicting him despite the absence of evidence required to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
Briefly, the facts, as presented by the prosecution and as given credence by the -lower court, are as follows:
Private complainant, Maribeth Esquilla, having been born on February 14, 1978 was 13 years old at the time of the commission of the crime charged on October 15, 1991. She and her younger brother, Bencio, 8 years old, lived with their paternal grandparents (their parents having separated in 1987), accused-appellant Felix Esquilla and his wife, in Surigao del Sur. After their grandmother died, Maribeth and her brother Bencio were left under the sole care of their grandfather, herein accused-appellant who thereupon moved to Managa, Bansalan,
Davao del Sur, bringing with him Maribeth and Bencio. There, they lived in a nipa hut in a small farm and slept together on the floor, side by side.
On October 15, 1991, at about 12 oâclock midnight, Maribeth was suddenly awakened when she felt someone on top of her. She was surprised when she saw it was her grandfather, accused-appellant herein, and noticed she was naked, her hands and legs spread apart tied with a rope. She could not shout because her mouth was covered with a piece of cloth and a knife was pointed at her. She tried to free herself but was unsuccessful. All she could do was to ask, in smothered and stifled supplications, why accused-appellant was doing this to her. He did not heed her pleas. He then sexually abused her. Her younger brother Bencio who slept with her was awakened and witnessed the sexual assault on his sister. He cried but to no avail. After satisfying his lust, accused-appellant untied Maribethâs hands and feet, left the house but without first threatening his victim and her brother with death if they reveal the incident to anybody.
On the afternoon of the next day, Maribeth left the house and proceeded to the house of one named Emiliana whose help Maribeth sought, narrating her agonizing experience. Emiliana brought Maribeth to the police station at Bansalan to report the incident and there had her medically examined. Dr. Anabelle Yumang, Municipal Health Officer of Banzalan, examined Maribeth and thereafter submitted the following:
Findings:
-    hymen with a healed complete laceration at 6:00 oâclock position corresponding to the face of a watch.
-    hymen orifice admits a tube 1.5 cm. in diameter with ease.
and concluded that the subjectâs ""physical virginity is lost.""
Consequently, on March 6, 1992, a complaint for rape against Felix Esquilla was formally filed before the Regional Trial Court of Bansalan, Davao del Sur.
As for the defense, its version of the incident is as follows:
On October 15, 1991, the date of the commission of the alleged crime imputed, accused-appellant was allegedly in his farm in Pananag. Maribeth was in Bansalan, having left the house sometime on September 15, 1991, after accused-appellant had beaten and punished her for gallivanting. From the time Maribeth left their house on September 15, 1991, she never returned and accused-appellant never saw her. He saw her only for the first time in court during the first hearing of the case.
Corroborating accused-appellantâs story, Teresita Velasquez declared that Maribeth was under her employ as a domestic helper in her house in Bansalan, Davao del Sur from September 7 to November 15, 1991. During the entire period of her employment, Maribeth never left the household. She added that Maribeth said that she ran away from the house of her ""Lolo"" with whom she had been staying. Velasquez also declared that at one time she saw an old man, later identified by Maribeth as her Lolo, on the road near her house. This man was calling Maribeth who, however, refused to talk to the man.
It is to be noted that the defense centers on denial, with accused-appellant arguing that the testimony of Maribeth is incredible.
Thus, accused-appellant avers that the trial court erred in convicting him because the testimony of the victim, Maribeth, is uncertain, contradictory, and filled with inconsistencies and material discrepancies sufficient to destroy her credibility. He argues that in her direct testimony, Maribeth declared that the crime happened on October 15, 1991 at 12 oâclock midnight (tsn., August 3, 1992, p. 7) while under cross-examination on August 3, 1992, she stated that she left accused-appellantâs house on October 11, 1991 for Poblacion, Bansalan to look for work and stayed thereat for 1-1/2 months, from October 11, 1991 (tsn., ibid., pp. 28-29). Thereafter she returned to Pananag, Managa, Bansalan but she did not go to accused-appellantâs house. Instead she proceeded to her cousinâs house (tsn., ibid., p. 29).
Indeed, the statements are contradictory. However, it should be remembered that the victim, Maribeth, was only 14 years old at the time she testified and, therefore, it is not unnatural should inconsistencies crop into her testimony as she is more prone to error than an adult person. In fact, minor inconsistencies may be expected of persons of such tender years.
The minor inconsistencies in Gloriaâs testimonies are to be expected. Protracted cross-examination of a 16-year old girl not accustomed to public trial would produce contradictions which nevertheless would not destroy her credibility. (
People vs. Gozum,
135 SCRA 295 [1995]).
We will not deviate from the rule that ""testimonies of rape victims who are young and immature are credible; the revelation of an innocent child whose chastity was abused demands full credence"" (
People vs. Guibao,
217 SCRA 64 [1993]; People vs. Bruca, 179 SCRA 64 [1989];
People vs. San Buenaventura,
164 SCRA 150 [1988];
People vs. Remoto,
244 SCRA 506 [1995]).
Too, the inconsistent statements Maribeth made as to the date and place of the commission of the crime are collateral or minor matters which do not at all touch upon the commission of the crime itself (
People vs. Jones,
137 SCRA 166 [1985];
People vs. Rosario,
159 SCRA 192 [1988]) nor affect Maribethâs credibility.
This Court has time and again held that inconsistencies in the testimony of witnesses with respect to minor details and collateral matters do not affect either the substance of their declaration, their veracity, or the weight of their testimony (
People vs. Pacala,
58 SCRA 370 [1974]; People vs. Pacnis, 165 SCRA 609 [1988]).
Maribethâs testimony that she was at the Bansalan Poblacion starting October 11, 1991 and stayed there for 1-1/2 months does not contradict her claim that she was raped by accused-appellant on October 15, 1991. She has narrated how the rape was committed. No contradictory statement was made by her as to how she was abused.
Inconsistency on matters of minor details do not detract from the actual fact of rape. Testimonial discrepancies would have been caused by the natural fickleness of memory which tend to strengthen rather than weaken credibility as they erase any suspicion of rehearsed testimony (
People vs. Cayago,
158 SCRA 586 [1988]) and do not destroy the substance of her testimony (
People vs. Aragon,
164 SCR4 78 [1988]).
When complainant left accused-appellantâs house is not decisive of the latterâs guilt or innocence. What is decisive in the rape charged is complainantâs positive identification of the accused-appellant as the malefactor (
People vs. Mustacisa,
159 SCRA 227 [1988];
People vs. Ramilo,
146 SCRA 257 [1986]).
The trial judge who had the opportunity to observe Maribethâs demeanor and deportment on the witness stand, was impressed with her manner of testifying and said ""her testimony was straightforward, simple and bereft of any vacillation"" (Decision, p. 3).
Accused-appellant next claims that there was ill motive on Maribethâs part in filing the rape charge because of the beatings inflicted upon her by accused-appellant for gallivanting and not coming home. Such argument is likewise without merit. No motive can be ascribed to complainant other than a desire for justice and redress for a terrible wrong inflicted on her (People vs. Cayago, 158 SCRA 586 [1988]). No young Filipina of decent repute would undergo the expense, trouble, inconvenience of a public trial, exposing herself to public shame and ridicule, suffer scandal, embarrassment and humiliation of a public trial and publicly admitting that she was criminally abused unless it is the truth (People vs. Avero, 165 SCRA 130 [1988];
People vs. Pacnis,
165 SCRA 609 [1988];
People vs. Magdaraog,
160 SCRA 153 [1988]). It is the victimâs natural instinct to protect her honor (
People vs. MuÃ±oz,
163 SCRA 730 [1988]). The complainant here would not file a charge as serious as rape against her very own grandfather simply because she was maltreated. Being the granddaughter of accused-appellant, only the compulsive motive to seek justice could be strong enough for her to implicate her own flesh and blood.
Anent the claim that the guilt of accused-appellant was not proved beyond reasonable doubt, suffice it to say that the law requires only moral certainty or ""that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudical mind"" (People vs. Bacalzo, 195 SCRA 557 [1991]; People vs. Gapasan, 243 SCRA 55 [1995]). Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean certainty as to exclude the possibility of error.
We find no reason to depart from the trial courtâs judgment of conviction. The weight and quantum of evidence needed to prove the guilt of accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt were met and established by the prosecution. An affirmance of the trial courtâs verdict is inevitable.
WHEREFORE,
the decision appealed from is hereby
AFFIRMED
with the slight modification that the civil indemnity of P20,000.00 is increased to P50,000.00 in conformity with current or existing jurisprudence. -Costs against accused-appellant.
SO ORDERED.

THIRD DIVISION
[ G.R. No. 107631, February 26, 1996 ]
NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. HON. COURT OF APPEALS AND PECORP, INC. (FORMERLYPACIFIC EQUIPMENT CORP.), RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N
FRANCISCO, J.:
The sole query here is whether or not the following two (2) claims
1. Fee on the cost of drilling and grouting which is ten percent (10%) of the Actual Final Cost of P6,962,519.50 - P696,251.95
2. Fee on the minimum guaranteed equipment rental which is ten percent (10%) of the Actual Final Cost of P 1.67 million - P 167,000.00
from a total of four (4) presented by herein private respondent PECORP, INC. (PECORP for brevity), can be brought for arbitration expressly provided for in the contract it entered into with herein petitioner National Power Corporation (NPC).
That contract forged between the government through the NPC and PECORP as party-CONTRACTOR on June 27, 1974 was for the construction of the Mariveles Dam No. 1 and appurtenant structures of the water supply system of the Bataan Export Processing Zone at Mariveles, Bataan.
It was agreed upon that the contract is of a ""Cost-Plus a Percentage"" type - meaning, PECORP will be paid a certain percentage as fee based on the ""Actual Final Cost"" of the work. And what constitutes ""Actual Final Cost"" has been aptly simplified by the trial court as ""the total cost to the defendant (NPC) of all the work performed by the plaintiff (PECORP) which includes cost of materials and supplies, structures, furnitures, charges, etc. and all other expenses as are inherent in a Cost-Plus and Percentage Contract and necessary for the prosecution of the work that are approved by the defendant x x x.""
The rift arose when NPC, in a letter dated July 11, 1974, communicated to PECORP that it was inclined to contract directly and separately with Philippine Grouting and Guniting Co., Inc. (GROGUN) for the drilling and grouting work on the construction project and consequently, PECORP will not be entitled to any fees for said task.
Contending that such NPC-GROGUN arrangement will violate its rights under the NPC-PECORP contract, PECORP made known to NPC its desire to bring the matter to arbitration, under Article VI of their contract, which reads:
""Should there occur any dispute, controversy, or differences between the parties arising out of this contract that cannot be resolved by them to their mutual satisfaction, the matter shall be submitted to arbitration at the choice of either party upon written demand to the other party. When formal arbitration is requested, an Arbitration Board shall be formed in the following manner: CORPORATION and CONTRACTOR shall each appoint one (1) member of this board and these members shall appoint a third member who shall act as chairman.""
The
NPC-GROGUN
drilling and grouting contract, nonetheless, pushed through on August 23, 1974. NPC tendered the following justifications for its execution:
1. The drilling and grouting work equipment were not included in the equipment availability schedules made jointly by NPC and PECORP at the start of the work.
2. PECORP failed to provide and/or rent equipment for the work and NPC could not immediately provide the equipments.
3. GROGUN had all the equipments and personnel required for the work.
4. The work could not suffer any further delay, considering that from the execution of the NPC-PECORP contract on June 27, 1974 up to the date of NPCâs letter to PECORP which was July 11, 1974, PECORP had not performed any drilling and grouting work.
5. NPC was availing of its alleged statutory right under Article 1725 of the Civil Code in removing the drilling and grouting work from the scope of its contract with PECORP (NPC-PECORP contract). Article 1725 reads:
""The owner may withdraw at will from the construction of the work, although it may have been commenced, indemnifying the contractor for all the latterâs expenses, work, and the usefulness which the owner may obtain therefrom, and damages.""
As a result of such purported ""withdrawal,"" the drilling and grouting work ceased to be a part of the
NPC-PECORP
contract and therefore,
a) is not an arbitrable matter thereunder, and
b) precludes
NPC
from collecting fees for said work. Besides, the cost of drilling and grouting work under the
NPC-GROGUN
contract is a direct cost to
NPC
and thus cannot be included in the ""Actual Final Cost"" under the
NPC-PECORP
contract on which
PECORPâs
fees are based.
PECORPâs
objection to the
NPC-GROGUN
contract insofar as it deprives PECORP of fees on drilling and grouting is essentially anchored on the following:
1. Drilling and grouting work is but a part of its over-all contractual duty, as expressed in Article II of the NPC-PECORP contract, to undertake the construction,
complete,
of the Mariveles Dam No. 1,
2.
PECORP
was expressly allowed under the
NPC-PECORP
contract to sub-contract labor, supplies and/or services, apparently in order to discharge fully its contractual duty.
PECORP
in fact intended to do just that, when even prior to the
NPCâs
letter of July 11, 1974,
PECORP
sought authorization from
NPC
to sub-contract the very same drilling and grouting work to the very same
GROGUN
in the proposed
NPC-GROGUN
contract. And even if the proposed
PECORP-GROGUN
sub-contract was turned down by NPC, PECORP is still entitled to the fees considering that the
NPC-GROGUN
contract would involve identical undertaking and party as that in the rejected sub-contract, not to mention that it was
PECORP
which actually supervised the drilling and grouting work conducted by
GROGUN.
Roughly five (5) years after, PECORP on June 14, 1979 presented to NPC four (4) claims - two of which are the subject claims mentioned at the beginning of this opinion and the other two are:
3. Fee on the inventory of unused stocks and POL   P 155,844.95
4. Reimbursement of Medical Hospital expenses re: TK-001 Accident case
P50,085.93,
coupled with a request for arbitration.
A board of arbitrators was thereafter convened. But after a series of written communications among the board, NPC and PECORP, it appeared that NPC was willing to arbitrate on claims (3) and (4) only. NPC resisted claim (1) (fee for drilling and grouting work) on grounds previously discussed. As to claim (2) (fee on the minimum guaranteed equipment rental), NPC argued that PECORP withdrew this claim from arbitration, as per PECORPâs letter to NPC dated May 19, 1980 which reads in full:
""We confirm our agreement earlier pertaining to our claim for payment for contractorâs fee in connection with the construction of the EPZA Dam No. 1 Project, whereby we are withdrawing our claim for fee on the guaranteed equipment rental hours for P167,000.00 in as much as this is an imputed cost and not direct cost as the rest of the claims. We understand however that the rest of the claims, in the sum of P902,182.58 shall be favorably adjudicated and endorsed.""
As
NPC
was uncompromising,
PECORP
filed an action in the Regional Trial Court of Manila to compel
NPC
to submit/confirm/certify all the four (4) claims for arbitration, where judgment was thereafter rendered in favor of
PECORP,
the dispositive portion of which reads:
""IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff PECORP, INC. and against National Power Corporation, ordering:
1. The Board of Administrators (sic) to reconvene and to arbitrate, the four (4) claims of the plaintiff against the defendant;
2. The defendant to submit and/or confirm and certify the four (4) claims for arbitration;
3. The parties to shoulder equally the expenses for arbitration;
4. The defendant to pay the plaintiff the amount of P 10,000.00 as and for attorneyâs fees;
5. The defendant to pay the costs of suit; and
6. The counterclaim is hereby dismissed for lack of merit.""
After the trial court denied NPCâs motion for reconsideration of its decision, respondent Court of Appeals, on appeal, affirmed the same but deleted the award of attorneyâs fees. However, in affirming said decision which merely ordered NPC and PECORP to arbitrate on all four (4) claims, respondent CA went further in disposing of issues which could have been appropriately ventilated and passed upon in the arbitration proceedings - a course of action apparently prompted by PECORPâs request as contained in its ""Motion For Early Resolution"" and reiterated in a ""Reiteration Motion For Early Resolution,"" that respondent CA make:
1. a definitive ruling on whether or not the withdrawal by NPC from PECORP of the drilling and grouting work in favor of GROGUN is a valid withdrawal of work under Article 1725 of the Civil Code, and
2. an outright resolution of PECORPâs claims against NPC, in order to obviate further prolonged proceedings or multiplicity of suits.
Thus, in its now-assailed judgment, respondent CA resolved PECORPâs claims for fees for drilling and grouting work (claim no. 1) and on the minimum guaranteed equipment rental hours (claim no. 2) in this wise:
As to claim no. 1:
""Art. II of the contract executed between appellee and appellant provides:
â
SCOPE OF WORK AND COMPLETION, DELAYS AND EXTENSION OF TIME.
"" For and in consideration of the payment or payments to be made by CORPORATION in accordance with the provisions of this contract, CONTRACTOR shall fully and faithfully furnish all labor, plant and materials and construct,
complete,
all works required for the Project, in accordance with the terms and conditions of all the documents mentioned under Art. I above.â
""Under the above-quoted provision, the NPC-Pecorp Contract is for the construction, complete, of the Mariveles Dam No. 1. Drilling and grouting work is just a part of the complete construction of the total project, hence, covered by and within the scope of the NPC-Pecorp Contract.
""The word âProjectâ is defined in the contract to mean the Dam and Appurtenant Structures. Drilling and Grouting is part of the dam or appurtenant structures, and therefore a part of PECORPâs scope of work.
""Appellant invokes Art. 1725 of the Civil Code to justify its claim that drilling and grouting is not included within the scope of the NPC-Grogun Contract with appellee.
""Art. 1725 reads:
âThe owner may withdraw at will from the construction of the work, although it may have been commenced, indemnifying the contractor for all the latterâs expenses, work and the usefulness which the owner may obtain therefrom, and damages.â
""Art. 1725 of the Civil Code is not applicable in the instant case, for the following reasons:
a) there was actually no withdrawal from the âconstruction of the work,â but only a transfer of a part of the construction, which is the drilling and grouting work;
b) said drilling and grouting still forms part of the project as a mere NPC-Grogun sub-contract.
""Since the NPC-Grogun Contract did not amend nor nullify the âcost plusâ provision of the NPC-Pecorp Contract, therefore, appellee Pecorp is still entitled to the said 10% fee.""
As to claim no. 2:
""x x x, appellant contends that since plaintiff-appellee had previously withdrawn (through its letter dated May 19, 1980), the claim for the minimum guaranteed equipment rentals hours for P167,000.00, the same is not covered by arbitration.
""The contention is likewise without merit.
""The letter dated May 19, 1980 (Annex ""2""), written by appellee to appellant partly reads:
âWe confirm our agreement earlier pertaining to our claim for payment of contractorâs fees in connection with the construction of the EPZA Dam No. 1 Project, whereby we are withdrawing our claim for fee on the minimum guaranteed equipment rental hours of P167,000.00, inasmuch as this is an imputed cost and not a direct cost of the rest of the claims. We understand however, that the rest of the claims, in the sum of P902,182.56 shall be favorably adjudicated and endorsed.â
""The above-quoted letter states that appellee was withdrawing its claim for fees in the minimum guaranteed equipment rental hours for P 167,000.00, only upon the condition that NPC will favorably adjudicate and endorse the three other PECORP claims, amounting to P902,182.58.
""Thus, it is clear that withdrawal is only a proposal conditioned upon NPCâs adjudication, endorsement and approval of all the three (3) other claims. However, as the record shows, NPC refused to certify for arbitration all the said three (3) other claims, hence, the withdrawal was rendered null and void.""
And from this second adverse judgment, NPC filed the instant petition raising the following errors:
I
Respondent court of appeals gravely erred in affirming the trial courtâs judgment with respect to the issue of private respondentâs right to claim percentage fee from the NPC-GROGUN Contract for Drilling, and Grouting Work.
II
Respondent court of appeals erred in not holding that private respondentâs claim for a fee on the minimum guaranteed equipment rental hours in the amount of P167,000.00 is not subject to arbitration since said claim had been previously withdrawn from arbitration by private respondent.
The petition must fail.
The trial courtâs short
raison dâ etre
for its order that all four (4) claims of PECORP against NPC be arbitrated upon by the arbitration board constituted by them, as merely prayed for by PECORP in its complaint, suffices in resolving the immediate conflict between NPC and PECORP. Indeed, PECORPâs two subject claims (1 and 2), together with the other two undisputed claims (3 and 4), directly and exclusively emanate from what PECORP firmly believes as contractually due it under the NPC-PECORP ""Cost-Plus a Percentage"" contract. Conversely therefore, had there been no NPC-PECORP contract, there would have been no dispute between NPC and PECORP that precipitated the suit for arbitration, as PECORPâs claims for fees, in such instance, would be inexistent in the first place. We thus quote with approval the trial courtâs findings and conclusion, that:
""The contract between the parties specifically provides as follows:
âARTICLE VI
ARBITRATION
Should there occur any
dispute controversy, or differences
between the parties arising out of this contract that cannot be resolved by them to their mutual satisfaction,
the matter shall be submitted for arbitration
at the choice of either party upon written demand to the other party. When formal arbitration is requested, an Arbitration Board shall be formed in the following manner: CORPORATION and CONTRACTOR shall each appoint one (1) member of this Board and these members shall appoint a third member who shall act as Chairman. x x x (Italics supplied for emphasis).â
""It will be noted that the above-quoted provision mentions any dispute, controversy and differences between the parties and without qualification as to the nature of the dispute or controversy or differences. Thus, having arisen from the contract, the four (4) claims are, therefore, arbitrable.
""Philippine Law and Jurisprudence recognize arbitration agreements as valid, binding, enforceable and not contrary to public policy, thus ""
âAny stipulation that the arbitratorsâ award or decision shall be final is valid, without prejudice to Articles 2036, 2039 and 2040 (Art. 200044, Now Civil Codes [sic]).â
âAn agreement to arbitrate is a contract, the relation of the parties is contractual and the rights and liabilities of the parties are controlled by the law of contracts. (5 AM. JUR. 2d 11).""
The Court likewise accords the same approval to respondent CAâs brief and straight to the point disquisitions (as quoted earlier) on why NPC cannot validly invoke Article 1725 of the Civil Code to prevent PECORP from collecting fees for drilling and grouting work conducted by GROGUN under the
NPC-GROGUN
contract, and why
PECORP
cannot be deemed to have abandoned or withdrawn its claim for fees on the minimum guaranteed equipment rental against NPC. Said judgment deserves full affirmance without further elaboration.
WHEREFORE,
the petition for review is hereby
DENIED,
and respondent CAâs assailed decision is
AFFIRMED.
SO ORDERED.

FIRST DIVISION
[ G.R. No. 112877, February 26, 1996 ]
SANDIGAN SAVINGS AND LOAN BANK, INC., AND SANDIGAN REALTY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, PETITIONERS, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND ANITA M. JAVIER, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N
HERMOSISIMA, JR., J.:
This Petition for Certiorari, with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order, seeks to review, modify and/or set aside the Resolution
[1]
dated 24 September 1993 and the Resolution
[2]
dated 19 November 1993 of public respondent National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC CAS RAB-III-05-1560-90. The former affirmed, with modification, the Decision
[3]
of the Labor Arbiter of the NLRC Regional Arbitration Branch No. III while the latter denied the motion to reconsider the former.
Private respondent Anita M. Javier (hereinafter referred to as Javier) worked as a realty sales agent of the petitioner Sandigan Realty Development Corporation (hereinafter called the Sandigan Realty) from November 2, 1982 (or November 9, 1982)
[4]
to November 30, 1986. Their agreement was that Javier would receive a 5% commission for every sale, or if no sale was made, she would receive a monthly allowance of P500.00.
Subsequently, that is, on 1 December 1986, Javier was hired as a marketing collector of petitioner Sandigan Savings and Loan Bank (hereinafter called the Sandigan Bank) by Angel Andan, the President of both the Sandigan Bank and Sandigan Realty. Javierâs monthly salary and allowance were initially in the amount of P788.00 and P5 85.00, respectively.
These were adjusted thereafter (the latest adjustment having been made on 1 July 1989), to P1,840.00 per month as salary and to P510.00 as monthly allowance, per ""Notice of Salary Adjustment.""
[5]
Meanwhile, respondent Javier continued to be a realty sales agent of Sandigan Realty on the side, and while she still received the 5% commission on her sales, she no longer enjoyed the P5 00.00 monthly allowance.
On 20 April 1990, Javier was advised by Angel Andan not to report for work anymore. This in effect was a notice of dismissal. The manner by which her dismissal was effected has been correctly described by the Solicitor General, thus:
""On April 20, 1990, around 8:30 in the morning, while performing her duties at the Bank, Javier saw and overheard petitioner Andan summon the Bankâs personnel officer, Mrs. Liberata G. Fajardo, and instruct her to prepare her (Javier âs) termination papers. Immediately thereafter, Andan changed his mind and told Mrs. Fajardo to prepare instead a resignation letter for Javier, saying, ""Ayaw ko na siyang makita sa susunod.â Turning to private respondent, he said, âHuwag na ninyong itanong kung anong dahilan, basta ât gusto ko, ito ang desisyon ko. Naawa lang ako sa iyo noon kaya kita tinanggap. Ka Anita, huwag mong isipin na may kinalaman ang mga pan gyayari kay Ditas, wala, wala, hindi iyon, basta ât si Alice, iniskandalo na naman ako.â
xxx      xxx      xxx
In the afternoon, after she received P50,000.00 from one Mr. Ben Santos as full payment for a lot sold in Sta. Rita Village, Guiguinto, Bulacan, Andan ordered Reynaldo Bordado, her co-employee, to withdraw her commission of P10,000.00 from the account of the Realty, saying, âIbigay mo sa ka Anita âyan para hindi na balikan dito. ""
[6]
The advice of her termination notwithstanding, Javier reported for work at the bank on the next working day or on 23 April 1990. Though she signed the attendance sheet, she left when she could not find her table.
On 18 May 1990, Javier filed a complaint against petitioners and Angel Andan with the NLRC Regional Arbitration Branch No. III at San Fernando, Pampanga, for illegal dismissal, seeking reinstatement and payment of backwages and moral and exemplary damages.
On October 6, 1992, the labor arbiter rendered judgment in private respondentâs favor, the dispositive portion of which reads:
""WHEREFORE, considering the foregoing considerations, and for having unjustly dismissed Anita Javier from employment, respondents are hereby directed to reinstate her to her former position as marketing collector of Sandigan Savings and Loan Bank and sales agent of Sandigan Realty Development Coiporation, pay her full backwages from the time of her dismissal, plus 10% attorneyâs fee and all her monetary award, until her actual reinstatement, and P60,000.00 moral and exemplary damages to compensate for her mental pain and anguish, her social humiliation and besmirched reputation. Should reinstatement be rendered impossible by virtue of the abolition of her position as marketing collector, grant her, in addition to backwages and other benefits, separation pay equivalent to one (1) month for every year of service until after this decision shall have become final and executory.""
[7]
On appeal, the NLRC affirmed the decision of the Labor Arbiter in its Resolution, dated 24 September 1993, but, deleting the award of damages and attorneyâs fees, provided the following monetary award of backwages and separation pay:
""Backwages:
Fr:
April 20, 1990-April 20, 1993-36 months
Realty:
P500.00 (allowance) x 36
P18,000.00
Savings Bank:
P2,400.00 x 36
P86,400.00
TOTAL
P104,400.00
Separation Pay:
Realty:
Nov. 2, 1982-April 20, 1993 P500.00 (allowance) x10
-10 years P5,000.00
Savings Bank:
Dec. 1, 1986-April 20, 1993 P2,400.00 x 6
- 6 years P14,400.00
GRAND TOTAL
P123,800.00""
The petitionersâ Motion for Reconsideration of the said Resolution, and that of the private respondent, were denied by the NLRC in its Resolution, dated 19 November 1993, the dispositive portion of which reads:
""It appearing that the issues raised by both parties in their Motions for Reconsideration were thoroughly discussed and duly passed upon in the questioned Resolution promulgated on September 24, 1993, the same are hereby denied for lack of merit with finality.
No further motion for reconsideration shall be entertained.
The petitioners, thus, instituted this petition for certiorari, contending that the NLRC gravely and seriously abused its discretion in holding that:
1. Javier is a regular employee of both Sandigan Realty and Sandigan Bank and entitled to backwages and separation pay from both;
2. Javier was receiving P2,400.00 a month from the bank and that she is entitled to separation pay for six years.
[8]
The records disclose that petitioner Sandigan Bank no longer disputes the finding that Javier was dismissed by it and that she did not abandon her job thereat. In fact, it would have paid private respondent the monetary award representing backwages and separation pay adjudged against it in the assailed NLRC resolution, if only it found the same to be in the correct amount.
[9]
Consequently, the issues in this case are: (1) whether or not the respondent NLRC abused its discretion in finding that private respondent was a regular employee of the petitioner Sandigan Realty, entitled to backwages and separation pay because of her alleged illegal separation therefrom; and (2) whether the computation of the monetary award owing to the private respondent, as contained in the assailed NLRC resolution, was attended with serious errors as to its bases both in fact and in law.
In determining the existence of an employer-employee relationship, the following elements are generally considered: (1) the selection and engagement of the employee; (2) the payment of wages; (3) the power of dismissal; and (4) the employerâs power to control the employee with respect to the means and methods by which the work is to be accomplished.
[10]
This Court has generally relied on the so-called ""right of control test"" in making such a determination. Where the person for whom the services are performed reserves a right to control not only the end to be achieved but also the means by which such end is reached,
[11]
the relationship is deemed to exist. Stated differently, it is the power of control which is the most determinative factor.
[12]
It is deemed to be such an important factor that the other requisites may even be disregarded.
[13]
Thus, in the case of
Cosmopolitan Funeral Homes, Inc. v. Maalat,
it was held that ""to determine whether a person who performs work for another is the latterâs employee or is an independent contractor, the prevailing test is âthe right of control test.â"" In the said case, the petitioner therein failed to prove that the contract with private respondent was that of a mere agency, an indication that subject person is free to accomplish his work on his own terms and may engage in other means of livelihood.
[14]
Viewed in the light of the foregoing criteria, the features of the relationship between Javier and the Sandigan Realty, as may be gleaned from the facts described herein below by the Office of the Solicitor General, readily negate the existence of an employer-employee relationship between them, the element of control being noticeably absent.
""Javier was hired in 1982 to sell houses or lots owned by the Realty. She was paid 5% commission for every lot or house sold. From 1982 up to 1986 when she was hired as a marketing collector of petitioner bank, she received from the Realty P500.00 monthly allowance if she was unable to make any sale. The P500.00 allowance ceased when she became a regular employee of the petitioner bank.
Javier sold houses or lots according to the manner or means she chose to. The petitioner realty firm, while interested in the result of her work, had no control with respect to the details of how the sale of a house or lot was achieved. She was free to adopt her own selling methods or free to sell at her own time (cf Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. v. NLRC, 179 SCRA 459 [1989]). Her obligation was merely to turn over the proceeds of each sale to the Realty and, in turn, the Realty paid her by the job, i.e., her commission, not by the hour.
Moreover, selling houses and lots was merely her sideline or extra work for a sister company. ""
[15]
As it appears that Sandigan Realty had no control over the conduct of Javier as a realty sales agent since its only concern or interest was in the result of her work and not in how it was achieved, there cannot now be any doubt that Javier was not an employee, much less a regular employee of the Sandigan Realty. Hence, she cannot be entitled to the right to security of tenure nor to backwages and separation pay as a consequence of her separation therefrom.
Evidently, the legal relation of Javier to the Sandigan Realty can be that of an independent contractor, where the control of the contracting party is only with respect to the result of the work, as distinguished from an employment relationship where the person rendering service is under the control of the hirer with respect to the details and manner of performance.
[16]
In the case of Sara v. Agarrado, private respondent who sold palay and rice for the petitioners under an arrangement or agreement that the former would be paid P2.00 commission per sack of milled rice sold as well as a commission of 10% per kilo of palay purchased,
[17]
and that she would spend her own money for the undertaking, and where she was shown to have worked for petitioners at her own pleasure, that she was not subject to definite hours or conditions of work, that she could even delegate the task of buying and selling to others, if she so desired, or simultaneously engaged in other means of livelihood while selling and purchasing rice or palay, was held to be an independent contractor.
[18]
By the same token, the private respondent in another case,
[19]
who earns on a per head/talent commission basis and who works as she pleases, on her own schedule, terms and conditions was also held to be an independent contractor.
Private respondent Anita Javier is clearly similarly placed as the private respondents in the above-cited cases. Hence, she could not have been a regular employee but an independent contractor in relation to the petitioner Sandigan Realty.
As we hold that private respondent was not a regular employee of the Sandigan Realty and that she could not, therefore, be entitled to backwages and separation pay, we will necessarily have to limit our treatment of the alleged errors committed by the NLRC in the computation of the monetary award to that adjudged against the petitioner Sandigan Bank. But, first, we have to settle the question as to whether reinstatement or payment of separation pay in its stead is the proper relief to be accorded the private respondent, it appearing that neither the labor arbiter nor the NLRC made a definitive ruling on the matter. This has become especially more significant since private respondent, in her Comment
[20]
and Memorandum,
[21]
presses for an order of reinstatement to her former position, claiming that there is no sufficient basis for a grant of separation pay in lieu thereof.
We agree with the private respondent in this respect.
Private respondent Anita Javier, by virtue of her employment status, is, under the law entitled to security of tenure, which means that she has the right to continue in employment until the same is terminated under conditions required by law. Article 279 of the Labor Code, as amended, clearly provides that:
""Security of Tenure. - In cases of regular employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause or when authorized by the Title. An employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to his full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and to his other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement.""
There being a finding of illegal dismissal of private respondent Anita Javier, her reinstatement should follow as a matter of course, unless it be shown that the same is no longer possible, in which case, payment of separation pay will be ordered, in lieu thereof.[22] In this case, we do not find any such showing or basis to preclude private respondentâs reinstatement.
In effect, the petitioner bank is liable to private respondent only for backwages, inclusive of allowances, and other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time her compensation was withheld from her up to the time of her actual reinstatement, at the rate of her latest monthly salary and allowance which was in the total amount of P2,350.00 as shown by Javierâs latest ""Notice of Salary Adjustment."" However, earnings derived elsewhere by Javier from the date of dismissal up to the date of reinstatement, if there be any, should be deducted from said backwages.
[23]
In this connection, it must be pointed out that the NLRC applied the old rule, otherwise known as the ""Mercury Drug Rule,"" and so, as to the rate of P2,400.00, no evidence was presented as basis. The rule that should apply in this case is that provided in Article 279 of the Labor Code, as amended by Section 34, Republic Act No. 6715, as aforequoted, which took effect on March 21, 1989, considering that the private respondentâs dismissal occurred thereafter, or on April 20, 1990.
WHEREFORE,
the petition is
GRANTED.
The assailed resolutions of the National Labor Relations Commission, dated 24 September 1993 and 19 November 1993, are hereby modified to conform both to our finding that private respondent was not a regular employee of Sandigan Realty Development Corporation but of the Sandigan Savings and Loan Bank, Inc. and to our determination respecting the monetary award to which the private respondent is entitled. The petitioner Sandigan Savings and Loan Bank, Inc. is hereby ordered to reinstate private respondent Anita Javier and to pay her backwages from April 20, 1990 up to the date of her actual reinstatement, less earnings derived elsewhere, if any.

PADILLA, J.:
I concur in the ponencia of Mr. Justice Regino Hermosisima, Jr. including its holding that because of the illegal dismissal, the backwages to be awarded to the dismissed employee (Anita Javier) should be reckoned from the date of illegal dismissal to date of actual reinstatement (thereby departing from the ""Mercury Drug Rule""). Article 279 of the Labor Code as amended by Rep. Act No. 6715 provides for such a period as the basis in the computation of backwages.
I do not however agree to the deduction from backwages of income or salaries earned by the employee from elsewhere during the period of her illegal dismissal. As I stated in my separate opinion in Pines City Educational Center v. NLRC, G.R. No. 96779, 10 November 1993, 227 SCRA 655:
""xxx       xxx       xxx.""
The amendment to Art. 279 of the Labor Code introduced by Rep. Act No 6715 inserted the qualification ""full"" to the word ""backwages."" The intent of the law seems to be clear. The plain words of the statute provide that an employee who is unjustly dismissed is entitled to FULL backwages from the time of his dismissal to actual reinstatement. The law provides no qualification nor does it state that income earned by the employee during the period between his unjust dismissal and reinstatement should be deducted from such backwages. When the law does not provide, the Court should not improvise.
It is further my view that the principle of unjust enrichment (if no deduction is allowed from backwages) does not apply in this case, for the following reasons:
1. The applicable provision of law should be construed in favor of labor.
2. The Labor Code is special law which should prevail over the Civil Code provisions on unjust enrichment.
3. The language employed by the statute and, therefore, its intent are clear. Where the unjust dismissal occurs after Rep. Act No. 6715 took effect, backwages must be awarded from the time the employee is unlawfully dismissed until the time he is actually reinstated. There is no provision authorizing deduction of any income earned by the employee during that period. The statutory formula was evidently crafted by the legislature not only for convenience and expediency in executing the monetary judgments in favor of the employees but also to prevent the employer from resorting to delaying tactics when the judgment is executed by pleading income earned by the employee before reinstatement as proper deductions from backwages. It is true that the dismissed employee may also resort to the same delaying tactics but when we consider the by and large inherent inequality of resources between employer and employee, the legislative formula would seem to be equitable. Besides and this we cannot over-stress - given the language of the law, the Court appears to have no alternative but to award such full backwages without deduction or qualification. Any other interpretation opens the Court to the charge of indulging in judicial legislation.
I therefore vote to award private respondents Roland Picart and Lucia Chan full backwages from time of their unjust dismissal to their actual reinstatement, without deduction or qualification in accordance with the mandate of the law (Rep. Act No. 6715)."""

ROMERO, J.,:
This is the sixth time that an issue or incident spawned by opposing claims of two sets of first cousins and, earlier, their respective mothers, over the Hacienda Escolastica in Mabini, Cadiz, Negros Occidental has been elevated to this Court for resolution. We resolve the instant petition for review on certiorari in the hope that, as one of them
[1]
says, ""peace and tranquility to all parties"" may at last be attained.
Hacienda Escolastica, consisting of Lots Nos. 936, 937, 940 and 941, originally covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. T-6536, T-6537, T-6538 and T-6539, has an area of 228.54 hectares. It belonged to the conjugal partnership of Pedro Zaldarriaga and Margarita Iforong. During their marriage, the couple begot four sons named Jesus, Jose, Manuel and Julio.
On May 17, 1919, Margarita died leaving one-half (1/2) or four-eighths (4/8) of the hacienda to her husband as his conjugal share and one-eighth (1/8) share to each of her sons. Thereafter, Manuel and Julio died single and without issue.  Their combined two-eighths (2/8) shares therefore passed by legal succession to their father, Pedro, who consequently became the owner of six-eighths (6/8) or three-fourths (3/4) share of the hacienda.
In 1944, Jose died survived by his wife, Basilia, and their seven children, named Carlos,
[2]
Jose, Alicia, Melba, Nelly, Pedro and Alfredo. Two years later or in 1946, Jesus also died. He was survived by his wife, Consuelo, and three children: Ernesto, Guadalupe and Jesus, Jr. Hence, Pedro outlived his four children.
On June 5, 1953, Basilia vda. de Zaldarriaga, acting as the judicial administratrix of the estate of Jose, filed Civil Case No. 2705 against the said surviving children of Jesus before the then Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, for the partition of the hacienda and for accounting of its rents, profits, produce and fruits. During the pendency of the case or on January 14, 1956, Pedro, the Zaldarriaga patriarch, executed a ""deed of definite sale"" conveying his 6/8 share in the hacienda to his grandchildren by Jesus, the defendants in the case. Consequently, TCT Nos. T-6536, T-6537, T-6538 and T-6539 were cancelled and TCT Nos. T-20122, T-19141, T-20143 and T-20124 corresponding to Lots Nos. 936, 937, 940 and 941 were issued to said grandchildren.  This turn of events also resulted in the amendment of the complaint in Civil Case No. 2705 in order that the nullification of the said sale would be made an integral part thereof.
On March 30, 1957, the lower court rendered a decision in Civil Case No. 2705 (1) declaring as null and void the order of the intestate court in Special Proceedings No. 483 which approved the project of partition and declaration of heirs made by Jesusâ children, and cancelling the sugar quotas listed in their names in the Sugar Quota Office; (2) declaring null and void the deed of sale of 6/8 portion of the hacienda which was executed by Pedro in favor of Jesusâ children; (3) ordering Pedro to account for and pay the intestate estate of Jose the amount of P94,586.00 representing rentals, profits and other claims, and to pay said estate every crop year P3,794.00 as rentals and P500.00 as profit, and (4) ordering the partition and distribution of the hacienda consisting of Lots Nos. 936, 937, 940 and 941 as follows: (a) to Pedro, 6/8 of the land or 172.68 hectares, 3/5 of the entire sugar quota of the hacienda for A sugar or 4479 piculs and 3/5 of the entire sugar quota for the hacienda for B and C sugar; (b) to the intestate estate of Jose or his heirs 28.78 hectares of the hacienda, 1/5 of the entire sugar quota for the hacienda for A sugar or 1493 piculs, and 1/5 of the entire sugar quota for B and C sugar; (c) to the legitimate heirs of Jesus, 28.78 hectares of the hacienda, 1/5 of the entire sugar quota for the hacienda for A sugar and 1/5 of the entire sugar quota for B and C sugar.
Since the boundaries of the respective shares of the co-owners had not yet been delineated and marked, the court appointed clerk of court Jose Azcona and Segundo Hipolito as commissioners pursuant to Sec. 3, Rule 71
[3]
of the Rules of Court.  The court also ordered Pedro to pay the intestate estate of Jose P15,000 as moral damages and P10,000.00 as exemplary or corrective damages and the heirs of Jesus to pay the same estate P5,000.00 as moral damages and P5,000.00 as exemplary damages. Both Pedro and the heirs of Jesus were ordered to pay the said estate P10,000.00 as attorneyâs fees and the costs of the suit.  The court also dismissed the defendantsâ counterclaim.
Two months later or on May 29, 1957, Pedro died. Consuelo vda. de Zaldarriaga, the widow of his son Jesus, was appointed judicial administratrix of his estate.  As such administratrix, Consuelo filed a notice of appeal, appeal bond and record on appeal from the said decision of March 30, 1957. Basilia, Joseâs widow, opposed the appeal contending that Consuelo had not really filed said requirements for an appeal but merely a motion asking for leave to adopt her (Basiliaâs) appeal bond and record on appeal.  The lower court sustained Basiliaâs opposition, thereby prompting Consuelo to file a petition for mandamus before this Court. Docketed as
L-13252,
the petition was decided on April 29, 1961
[4]
against petitioner Consuelo with the Court holding that ""a decision or order directing partition is not final because it leaves something more to be done in the trial court for the complete disposition of the case."" Hence, the Court therein denied the petition but instructed the lower court ""to proceed in Civil Case No. 2705 in accordance with this decision and the procedure provided in Rule 71 of the Rules of Court.""
For her part, Basilia appealed the decision in Civil Case No. 2705 to this Court. It was docketed as
L-13424.
On May 31, 1961, the Court dismissed the appeal
[5]
on the ground that it was taken prematurely as, consonant with its ruling in L-13252, the decision appealed from was merely interlocutory because the lower court still had to go through the proceedings outlined in Rule 71.
Accordingly, the appointed commissioners began to partition the hacienda. On December 1, 1962, they submitted their report which the court approved on May 3, 1963.  The respective shares of the parties were raffled among them and that of the plaintiffs (Basilia and her children) was accordingly adjudicated to them by the lower court.
Clearly dissatisfied with the final decision of the lower court, Consuelo and her children appealed to this Court through L-21888. In the decision of June 26, 1967,
[6]
this Court, for lack of jurisdiction over the amount in controversy (totalling P156,886.00), remanded the case to the Court of Appeals as this Court at that time could take jurisdiction only over claims on properties valued at more than P200,000.00.
Thus, taking jurisdiction over the appeal, the Court of Appeals decided CA-G.R. No. 39743-R on September 30, 1971.
[7]
It found that the hacienda had been ""partitioned in 1919 among the heirs"" of Margarita; that Pedro and his four sons entered into an extrajudicial agreement assigning unto themselves definite portions of the hacienda; that except for Jose, each of them took possession of his share and cultivated it; that Jose tilled and planted his portion only in 1942 to 1944 and thereafter it was left idle; that from 1919 until his death in 1944, Jose never asked for his share in the produce of his father and brothers; that while the 7/8 portion of the hacienda was tilled and developed, its southern portion corresponding to the 1/8 share of Jose was left uncultivated;
[8]
that, by the number of years that defendants (Consuelo and her children) had been openly and adversely in possession of the 7/8 portion, they had acquired exclusive ownership thereof and prescription had cured whatever defects there might have been in title or acquisition; that from 1919 to 1953 or for 34 years, plaintiffs (Basilia and her children) did not claim the fruits of the hacienda nor demand its partition, and that Basilia herself was guilty of laches in waiting for almost a decade before bringing an action in court. In view of these facts, the Court of Appeals resolved to ""forego discussion of the other errors raised by defendants which are thereby rendered academic"" and reversed the decision of the lower court in Civil Case No. 2705.
However, the finality of said decision on January 4, 1972
[9]
did not deter Basilia from elevating the same decision to this Court through a petition for review on certiorari docketed as
L-34557.
[10]
On February 3, 1972, this Court promulgated minute resolution:
""L-34557 (Basilia F. Vda. de Zaldarriaga, etc. v. Pedro Zaldarriaga, deceased, substituted by Consuelo Tan Vda. de Zaldarriaga, etc., et al.). - Considering the allegations of, the issues raised and the arguments adduced in the petition for review on certiorari of the decision of the Court of Appeals, THE COURT RESOLVED to deny the petition for being factual (insufficient showing that findings of fact are unsupported by substantial evidence) and for lack of merit. The manifestation of counsel for petitioner, dated January 28, 1972, is NOTED.""
[11]
Basilia filed a motion for the reconsideration of the said resolution. On May 8, 1972, this Court denied it in the following resolution:
""Upon consideration of the motion for reconsideration of the petitioner in G.R. No. L-34557, Basilia F. Vda. de Zaldarriaga, etc. vs. Pedro Zaldarriaga, etc., et al., and the opposition thereto of respondents, and it appearing that without considering the offer of evidence, assuming that this should not have been taken into account by the Court of Appeals (even if its holding that the so-called dead-manâs statuteâ does not apply to this case) is correct, there is substantial evidence to sustain the appellate courtâs conclusion that the properties herein involved had already been previously partitioned before the death of petitionerâs husband, Jose Zaldarriaga, and that it is clear that neither her deceased husband during her lifetime, nor the petitioner ever laid claim to the sugar quotas alleged in the complaint for over 33 years, for which reason, the present action has prescribed, and considering that it is indisputable, at this stage, that there is a specific 1/8 portion of the Hacienda share belonging to petitioner in the estate of her husbandâs mother, and if it has remained uncultivated and unproductive, it is because petitioner, and her husband before her, have failed to work on the same, and that, as held by the Court of Appeals, the other causes of action of petitioner have already become academic, the same being premised on the nonexistence of the partition found by the appellate court as having been effected during the lifetime of petitionerâs husband, the Court resolved to DENY the motion for reconsideration
without
prejudice
to
whatever
action
not
yet
prescribed,
that
the
children,
if
any,
of
the
late
Jose
Zaldarriaga
may
have
for
the

share
in
the
lands
in
question
as

of

estate
of
the

Pedro
Zaldarriaga.
"" (Italics supplied.)
[12]
Acting on cue, the following year, or on June 19, 1973, Basilia and her children filed Civil Case No. 117-V against Consuelo and her children before the then Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental. Claiming three-eighths (3/8) or one-half (1/2) of Pedroâs six-eighths (6/8) share in the hacienda which allegedly was ""fictitiously conveyed"" to Consueloâs children, they prayed that the deed of sale executed by Pedro as regards said portion of the hacienda be declared void
ab
initio;
that 3/8 or 1/2 of the said estate of Pedro be reconveyed to them, and that said property be partitioned with accounting of its produce plus moral damages.
[13]
In their answer with counterclaim, the defendants alleged that the action was barred by
res
judicata.
[14]
They further alleged lack of personality to sue on the part of the plaintiffs, no cause of action and prescription. Thereafter, they filed a motion for preliminary hearing under Sec. 5, Rule 16 of the Rules of Court at the same time seeking the dismissal of the complaint on the ground of
res
judicata.
[15]
The plaintiffs opposed this motion.
On September 4, 1973, the lower court, through Judge Victoriano C. Teleron, issued a resolution dismissing the complaint and sustaining the defendantsâ theory of
res
judicata.
[16]
On the plaintiffsâ contention that assuming that all the requisites for the application of the principle of res judicata were obtaining in the case, the same principle was nevertheless inapplicable considering the ""reservation"" made by this Court in the May 8, 1972 resolution in G.R. No. 34557 that the heirs of Jose may file ""whatever action, not yet prescribed, that they may have for the recovery of their shares in the lands in question as part of the estate"" of Pedro, the lower court said the reservation should ""refer to some rights of the children of the late Jose Zaldarriaga
other
than
the
subject-matter
now
litigated
in instant case"" otherwise it would be assumed that ""the appellate Courts were being deliberately inconsistent in its judgments and, against its established doctrines, encouraging multiplicity of suits affecting the same causes of action over the same subject-matter between the same parties.""
Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration and/or new trial on the ground that the said lower court resolution was contrary both to the actual facts of the case and to law.
[17]
Defendants countered with a motion to strike off the record and/or to dismiss the said motion for reconsideration on the ground that the same was a mere scrap of paper which should not be acted upon by the court.
[18]
Acting on said motions of the parties, on April 30, 1974, the court
[19]
denied defendantsâ motion, granted plaintiffsâ motion for reconsideration and reconsidered and set aside its resolution of September 4, 1973.
[20]
As expected, the defendants filed a motion for the reconsideration of the April 30, 1974 order but the court denied the same. Hence, they filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals. Docketed as CA-G.R. No. 03164-R, the petition raised as principal issue the applicability of the principle of
res
judicata,
stressing that the plaintiffsâ action to nullify the deed of sale dated January 14, 1956 had been barred by the judgment in CA-G.R. No. 39743-R. On the other hand, plaintiffs-respondents invoked once again the significance of the reservation clause in this Courtâs resolution in L-34557 which, they believed, ""defoliates the legal posture of the defendants.""
On July 21, 1975, the Court of Appeals rendered a decision
[21]
dismissing the petition for
certiorari
and rejecting the
res
judicata
theory.  The appellate court reasoned in this wise:
""Even assuming, arguendo, that another case, Civil Case No. 2705 between the parties herein, which case is interrelated with the principal case, Civil Case No. 117-V, had already been decided by the Supreme Court in L-34557, the ground of res judicata as raised in the motion to dismiss the complaint cannot be sustained by virtue of the Supreme Courtâs ruling in L-34557 to the effect that its decision is without prejudice to whatever action, not yet prescribed, that the children, if any, of the late Jose Zaldarriaga may have for the recovery of their share in the lands in question as part of the estate of the now deceased Pedro Zaldarriaga.""
Petitioners therein filed a motion for reconsideration of the said decision but it was denied by the Court of Appeals. Their second motion for reconsideration met the same fate.  Undaunted, they brought the matter to this Court through a petition for review on certiorari docketed as
L-42177
and entitled ""Ernesto Zaldarriaga v. Court of Appeals, et al."" This Court denied the petition for lack of merit in the minute resolution of February 11, 1976.[22] Petitionersâ motion for reconsideration was likewise denied on March 31, 1976.
[23]
Meanwhile, in the lower court, the plaintiffs (Basilia and her children) filed on July 25, 1975 a motion for leave to amend their complaint citing as reason therefor oversight in alleging in the complaint ""the distribution of the estate of Pedro Zaldarriaga.""
[24]
Annexed to the motion was the amended complaint itself.
[25]
In due course, the parties filed a partial stipulation of facts and trial on the merits of the case ensued. On September 9, 1986, the lower court[26] rendered a decision in Civil Case No. 117-V in favor of the plaintiffs.
[27]
It decreed thus:
""WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:
(1) - declaring null and void the âDeed of Definite Saleâ executed on January 14, 1956 by the late Pedro Zaldarriaga in favor of defendants Ernesto Zaldarriaga, Guadalupe Zaldarriaga and Jesus Zaldarriaga, Jr.;
(2)     - ordering the cancellation of transfer certificates of title Nos. T-20122, T-19141, T-20123 and T-20124 covering Lots 936, 937, 940 and 941 of Cadiz Cadastre, respectively and the reinstatement of transfer certificates of title Nos. T-6536, T-6537, T-6538 and T-6539 covering aforesaid lots, respectively;
(3)     - ordering the partition of Lots Nos. 936-B, 937 and 941-A of Cadiz Cadastre, constituting the estate of Pedro Zaldarriaga under the 1919 oral partition, with one-half (1/2) thereof to belong to plaintiffs and the other one-(half) (1/2) to appertain to defendants and ordering defendants to execute a formal deed of conveyance in favor of plaintiffs covering their shares in said Lots Nos. 936-B, 937 and 941-A of Cadiz Cadastre. For this purpose, Atty. Fe Las PiÃ±as-Gicano and Mr. Edilberto Y. Empestan are hereby appointed as commissioners (Sec. 3, Rule 69, Rules of Court) who, after having qualified by taking their oath, shall make and effect an equitable separation, delineation and partition of aforesaid lots in accordance with this decision and, thereafter, shall make a full report to this Court of the proceedings respecting the partition.
(4) - ordering the defendants to execute a formal deed of conveyance covering Lots Nos. 940 and 941-B in favor of plaintiffs who are now actually possessing said lots;
(5) - ordering the defendants to cause the titles of plaintiffs, after partition, to be free from the liens particularly the mortgage encumbrances, constituted by the defendants on Hda. Escolastica;
(6) - ordering the defendants to pay, jointly and severally, the plaintiffs the sum of P2,935,693.40 plus interest at the legal rate from the date of filing of the complaint until the amount is fully paid and to pay the plaintiffs the money equivalent of 4,095.95 piculs a year from 1977-1978 crop year up to the time that the shares of plaintiffs in the estate of the late Pedro Zaldarriaga are delivered to them by defendants, to be computed on the basis of the price fixed by the PHILSUCOM;
(7) - ordering the defendants to account for all lease rentals paid by Hanil Development Co., Ltd. for its use of the land for its crusher site and batching plant and to deliver to plaintiffs one-half (1/2) of said rentals;
(8) - ordering the defendants to pay, jointly and severally, the plaintiffs attorneyâs fees in the amount of P30,000.00 plus P500.00 for every court appearances; and
(9) - ordering the defendants to pay the costs of suit.
Defendantsâ counterclaims are dismissed.
SO ORDERED.""
Defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals contending that the lower court was barred by prior judgment as regards the validity of the deed of sale executed by Pedro in their favor and that the award of damages was without basis in fact and in law (CA-G.R. No. CV No. 14450).
On July 14, 1989, the Court of Appeals rendered a decision
[28]
affirming
in
toto
the lower courtâs decision of September 9, 1986. In holding that the principle of
res
judicata
was inapplicable, the Court of Appeals said that ""(T)he issue of the nullity or validity of the sale by the late Pedro Zaldarriaga to the herein appellants (his grandchildren), was not resolved by this Court in CA-G.R. No. 39743-R"" because what was resolved therein was the issue of partition. As regards the validity of the deed of sale, the Court of Appeals noted that the defendants-appellants significantly ""did not present any evidence at all to show that the deed of sale x x x was not simulated"" and repeated the lower courtâs reasons for finding that the deed of sale was simulated and fictitious.
[29]
On the ""reservation clause"" in this Courtâs resolution in L-34557, it said:
""Appellants further put forth the thesis that the reservation clause in the SC resolution dated May 8, 1972 encompasses only the reservable property to be inherited by the children of the late Jose Zaldarriaga; and that it should not be interpreted to include the property of the late Pedro Zaldarriaga under the deed of sale declared as fictitious by the trial court.
Again, the appellants have misinterpreted the full import and meaning of the reservation clause. The resolution of the Supreme Court does not say that the reservation clause should be confined to only the property subject of
reserva
troncal.
As can be gleaned from the reservation clause, it speaks of the childrenâs share âin the lands in question as part of the estate of the now deceased Pedro Zaldarriaga.â The entire estate of the deceased Pedro Zaldarriaga was âsoldâ by him to the appellants (his other grandchildren). To recover their shares in the estate of their grandfather, appellees necessarily have to institute proceedings for the nullification of the simulated âdeed of sale.""
With respect to the award of damages, the Court of Appeals held that since the damages claimed by appellees ""consist mainly of the fruits of their shares from the time of the death of Pedro Zaldarriaga (Art. 777 of the Civil Code) until the delivery to them of their respective shares,"" the lower court correctly awarded them.
Appellants filed a motion for the reconsideration of said decision but it was denied for lack of merit on September 19, 1989.[30] Thus, the children of Jesus filed the instant petition for review on certiorari.  They contend that the Court of Appeals erred: (a) in interpreting the so-called ""reservation clause"" as a ground to relitigate issues which should have been barred by established jurisprudence and doctrines; (b) when it held that the issue of prior judgment had been laid to rest by the Court of Appeals decision of July 21, 1975 in CA-G.R. No. 03164-R which affirmed both orders of June 30, 1974 and June 11, 1974; (c) in not finding that the complaint below lacks cause of action; (d) in declaring void the deed of definite sale on badges of fraud, and (e) in dismissing their counterclaim.
The several complaints, petitions and appeals arising from the same controversy which were filed by the parties in the court below, the Court of Appeals and this Court within a span of forty years creates a dizzying labyrinth of unresolved issues.  Considering however, that the cases are centered on the 6/8 share of Pedro Zaldarriaga in Hacienda Escolastica which appears to be his whole estate, the core problem to be solved is: who owned said property upon Pedroâs death - Pedro himself, in which case the property shall pass by intestacy to his descendants in accordance with the law on succession, or the children of Jesus by virtue of the deed of sale in their favor, to the exclusion of the heirs of Jose?  Since two complaints had been filed by the heirs of Jose, the ultimate solution to the problem may be found only upon a close examination of the proceedings had and the issues resolved in said cases.  Thus, delving deeply into the allegations of both parties, the issue for resolution in the instant petition for review on certiorari is quite simple: may the principle of
res
judicata
be applied vis-a-vis the ""reservation clause"" enunciated by this Court in its resolution of May 8, 1972 in L-34557?
At the outset, it should be made clear that the inapplicability of the principle of
res
judicata
had been ruled upon by this Court in favor of private respondents in L-42 177 in affirming the decision in CA-G.R. No. 03164-R.
Moreover, considering the peculiar circumstances in this case, we find that
res
judicata
does not find application in the instant petition as it would not serve the interest of substantial justice.  The principle of
res
judicata
is a fundamental component of our judicial system but, as this Court has time and again held, it should be disregarded if its application would involve the sacrifice of justice to technicality.
[31]
If the principle should be applied at all, it should be in the context of its less familiar concept which the Court expounded in
Vda. de Cruzo v. Carriaga, Jr.
[32]
as follows:
""(The) less terminological usage of res judicata as a rule on conclusiveness of judgment refers to the situation where the judgment in the prior action operates as an estoppel only as to the matters actually determined therein or which were necessarily included therein. Consequently, since other admissible and relevant matters which the parties in the second action could properly offer are not concluded by the said judgment, the same is not a bar to or a ground for dismissal of the second action.""
The issue of the validity of the deed of sale had been offered for resolution in Civil Case No. 2705.  But, even after the Court of Appeals had
implicitly
considered it in CA-G.R. No. 34793-R, this Court predicated the resolution of May 8, 1972 in L-34557 upon the issue of partition notwithstanding the private respondentsâ vigorous espousal of the nullity of the deed of sale in their petition before this Court wherein they"" correctly contended:
""Again, on another cause of action in plaintiffâs (sic) the court a quo had held that the sale by defendant Pedro Zaldarriaga of his entire share (6/8) of the hacienda, including the sugar quota, to his co-defendants
was
fictitious
and
fraudulent,
hence it was annulled and set aside. Certainly, said portion of the trial courtâs decision - we humbly submit - cannot be passed over by the Court of Appeals, on the ground that the matter had become academic because of the finding that there was partition. Indeed, how could the matter of the annulment of the sale become academic, especially with the death of Pedro Zaldarriaga his share in the property becomes part of his estate to be inherited by Jesus and Jose (represented by their children and his surviving spouse) (Art. 986, Civil Code of the Philippines). In other words, the question as to whether the sale was null and void, on the ground that it was fictitious and fraudulent, is a material issue which is not resolved by the mere fact that the court had made a finding that there was already a partition of the property.""
[33]
Nonetheless, in the same May 8, 1972 resolution, the Court, exercising its discretion, considered the issue of the validity of the deed of sale as a matter which should be litigated in another action pertaining to the estate of Pedro.  In this regard, it should be underscored that when Civil Case No. 117-V was filed, the action to nullify the deed of sale had not yet prescribed considering that the issue was raised in Civil Case No. 2705 as soon as the lots involved were sold and registered in petitionersâ name.
[34]
The amendment of the complaint in Civil Case No. 2705 to include the prayer for the nullity of the deed of sale amounted to the filing of an action thereon which interrupted the running of the prescriptive period.
[35]
Thus, by appending the ""reservation clause"" in the resolution of May 8, 1972, this Court in effect waived the applicability of the principle of
res
judicata
. A ""reservation"" for the filing of another action in a decision which is usually preceded by the phrase ""without prejudice"" imports the contemplation of further proceedings. When said phrase appears in an order or decree, it implies that the judicial act is not intended to be res judicata on the merits of the controversy.
[36]
While in
Gatus
v.
Court
of
Appeals
[37]
the Court held that a reservation not falling within the provisions of Rule 17 of the Rules of Court
[38]
is a ""mere surplusage, for, whenever the law gives a party the right to bring an action, he may do so without the necessity of any judicial reservation,"" the reservation made by this Court in L-34557 in the exercise of its discretion was aimed at giving the private respondents another opportunity to ventilate their valid claims to Pedroâs estate.
Worth noting is the fact that in both Civil Cases Nos. 2705 and 1 17-V. the lower court arrived at the same conclusion regarding the nullity of the deed of sale.  That fact, considered with the affirmance by the Court of Appeals of the decision in Civil Case No. 1 17-V, deters this Court from examining further the other conclusions of said courts on the merits of the case, which, after all, are sound and based on law.
The protracted controversy over the estate of Pedro Zaldarriaga has gone through an extraordinary and circuitous route. It is high time the controversy is laid to rest and his descendants allowed to peacefully enjoy the estate in accordance with law.
WHEREFORE,
the instant petition for review on certiorari is hereby
DENIED.
The July 14, 1989 decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 14450 and that of the lower court in Civil Case No. 117-V are
AFFIRMED.
This decision is immediately executory.  Costs against petitioners.

The lower courtâs reasons are:""(1) the filing of Civil Case No. 2705 must have angered Pedro Zaldarriaga and the sale was his retaliatory act to deprive his other grandchildren, represented by his daughter-in-law, of their legitimate (sic) in the estate; (2) the sale executed by Pedro Zaldarriaga purports to convey his entire estate or property consisting of 6/8 share in Hda. Escolastica consisting of four parcels of land designated as Lots Nos. 936, 937, 940 and 941 of Cadiz Cadastre. But, the entire Lots Nos. 940 and 941-B of Cadiz Cadastre are admitted by defendants to have been adjudicated to the heirs of Jose Zaldarriaga under the 1919 oral partition; (3) the vendees (defendants) are the grandchildren of the vendor and they are all living in one house before and at the time of the sale, and even thereafter; (4) Pedro Zaldarriaga continued to be in possession and in cultivation of Hda. Escolastica; (5) the purchase price of P100,000.00 stated in the deed of definite sale is grossly disproportionate to the market value of the property declared for taxation purposes at P1,893,650.00. The fact that defendants were able to mortgage this property for a total of P4,122,400.00 only underscores this disparity; (6) at the time of the sale, Pedro Zaldarriaga was already old and there is no evidence at all, because defendants never presented any, to show that he was in need of so much money that he had to sell all his property, and especially, if viewed in the light that he was earning from the lands sold to defendants; (7) there was no evidence showing that at the time, vendees have lucrative means of livelihood to enable them to purchase the estate of Pedro Zaldarriaga. They do not have any property registered in their names. In fine, the sale by Pedro Zaldarriaga is void and of no effect since it is violative of Art. 221 of the Civil Code. It was a simulated alienation of property with intent to deprive the plaintiffs, as compulsory heirs, of their legitime."" (Decision in Civil Case No. 1 17-V. pp. 18-19; Rollo, pp. 284-285).

[SYLLABUS]
[ G.R. No. 97785, March 29, 1996 ]
PHILIPPINE COMMERCIAL INTERNATIONAL BANK, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND
RORY W. LIM, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N
FRANCISCO, J.:
This is a petition for review on certiorari seeking the reversal of the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 18843 promulgated on July 30, 1990, and the Resolution dated March 11, 1991, affirming with modification the judgment of the Regional Trial Court of Gingoog City which held petitioner Philippine Commercial International Bank (PCIB) liable for damages resulting from its breach of contract with private respondent Rory W. Lim.
Disputed herein is the validity of the stipulation embodied in the standard application form/receipt furnished by petitioner for the purchase of a telegraphic transfer which relieves it of any liability resulting from loss caused by errors or delays in the course of the discharge of its services.
The antecedent facts are as follows:
On March 13, 1986, private respondent Rory Lim delivered to his cousin Lim Ong Tian PCIB Check No. JJJ 24212467 in the amount of P200,000.00 for the purpose of obtaining a telegraphic transfer from petitioner PCIB in the same amount.  The money was to be transferred to Equitable Banking Corporation, Cagayan de Oro Branch, and credited to private respondentâs account at the said bank. Upon purchase of the telegraphic transfer, petitioner issued the corresponding receipt dated March 13, 1986 [T/T No. 284]
[1]
which contained the assailed provision, to wit:
""AGREEMENT
xxx                xxx                  xxx
In case of fund transfer, the undersigned hereby agrees that such transfer will be made without any responsibility on the part of the BANK, or its correspondents, for any loss occasioned by errors, or delays in the transmission of message by telegraph or cable companies or by the correspondents or agencies, necessarily employed by this BANK in the transfer of this money, all risks for which are assumed by the undersigned.""
Subsequent to the purchase of the telegraphic transfer, petitioner in turn issued and delivered eight (8) Equitable Bank checks
[2]
to his suppliers in different amounts as payment for the merchandise that he obtained from them.  When the checks were presented for payment, five of them bounced for insufficiency of funds,
[3]
while the remaining three were held overnight for lack of funds upon presentment.
[4]
Consequent to the dishonor of these checks, Equitable Bank charged and collected the total amount of P1, 100.00 from private respondent. The dishonor of the checks came to private respondentâs attention only on April 2, 1986, when Equitable Bank notified him of the penalty charges and after receiving letters from his suppliers that his credit was being cut-off due to the dishonor of the checks he issued.
Upon verification by private respondent with the Gingoog Branch Office of petitioner PCIB, it was confirmed that his telegraphic transfer (T/T No. 284) for the sum of P200,000.00 had not yet been remitted to Equitable Bank, Cagayan de Oro branch. In fact, petitioner PCIB made the corresponding transfer of funds only on April 3, 1986, twenty one (21) days after the purchase of the telegraphic transfer on March 13,1986.
Aggrieved, private respondent demanded from petitioner PCIB that he be compensated for the resulting damage that he suffered due to petitionerâs failure to make the timely transfer of funds which led to the dishonor of his checks. In a letter dated April 23, 1986, PCIBâs Branch Manager Rodolfo Villarmia acknowledged their failure to transmit the telegraphic transfer on time as a result of their mistake in using the control number twice and the petitioner bankâs failure to request confirmation and act positively on the disposition of the said telegraphic transfer.
[5]
Nevertheless, petitioner refused to heed private respondentâs demand prompting the latter to file a complaint for damages with the Regional Trial Court of Gingoog City
[6]
on January 16, 1987.  In his complaint, private respondent alleged that as a result of petitionerâs total disregard and gross violation of its contractual obligation to remit and deliver the sum of Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P200,000.00) covered by T/T No. 284 to Equitable Banking Corporation, Cagayan de Oro Branch, private respondentâs checks were dishonored for insufficient funds thereby causing his business and credit standing to suffer considerably for which petitioner should be ordered to pay damages.
[7]
Answering the complaint, petitioner denied any liability to private respondent and interposed as special and affirmative defense the lack of privity between it and private respondent as it was not private respondent himself who purchased the telegraphic transfer from petitioner.  Additionally, petitioner pointed out that private respondent is nevertheless bound by the stipulation in the telegraphic transfer application/form receipt
[8]
which provides:
""x x x. In case of fund transfer, the undersigned hereby agrees that such transfer will be made without any responsibility on the part of the BANK, or its correspondents, for any loss occasioned by errors or delays in the transmission of message by telegraph or cable companies or by correspondents or agencies, necessarily employed by this BANK in the transfer of this money, all risks for which are assumed by the undersigned.""
According to petitioner, they utilized the services of RCPI-Gingoog City to transmit the message regarding private respondentâs telegraphic transfer because their telex machine was out of order at that time.  But as it turned out, it was only on April 3, 1986 that petitionerâs Cagayan de Oro Branch had received information about the said telegraphic transfer.
[9]
In its decision dated July 27, 1988
[10]
the Regional Trial Court of Gingoog City held petitioner liable for breach of contract and struck down the aforecited provision found in petitionerâs telegraphic transfer application form/receipt exempting it from any liability and declared the same to be invalid and unenforceable.  As found by the trial court, the provision amounted to a contract of adhesion wherein the objectionable portion was unilaterally inserted by petitioner in all its application forms without giving any opportunity to the applicants to question the same and express their conformity thereto.
[11]
Thus, the trial court adjudged petitioner liable to private respondent for the following amounts:
""WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff and against the defendant, ordering the latter to pay the former as follows:
P960,000.00 as moral damages;
P50,000.00 as exemplary damages;
P40,000.00 as attorneyâs fees; and
P1,100.00 as reimbursement for the surcharges paid by plaintiff to the Equitable Banking Corporation, plus costs, all with legal interest of 6% per annum from the date of this judgment until the same shall have been paid in full.""
[12]
Upon appeal by petitioner to the Court of Appeals, respondent court affirmed with modifications the judgment of the trial court and ordered as follows:
""WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered affirming the appealed decision with modification, as follows:
The defendant-appellant is ordered to pay to the plaintiff-appellee the following:
1.  The sum of Four Hundred Thousand (P400,000.00) Pesos as/for moral damages;
2.  The sum of Forty Thousand (P40,000.00) Pesos as exemplary damage to serve as an example for the public good;
3.  The sum of Thirty Thousand (P30,000.00) Pesos representing attorneyâs fees;
4.  The sum of One Thousand One Hundred (P1,100.00) Pesos as actual damage, and
5.  To pay the costs.
SO ORDERED.""
[13]
A motion for reconsideration was filed by petitioner but respondent Court of Appeals denied the same.
[14]
Still unconvinced, petitioner elevated the case to this Court through the instant petition for review on certiorari invoking the validity of the assailed provision found in the application form/receipt exempting it from any liability in case of loss resulting from errors or delays in the transfer of funds.
Petitioner mainly argues that even assuming that the disputed provision is a contract of adhesion, such fact alone does not make it invalid because this type of contract is not absolutely prohibited.  Moreover, the terms thereof are expressed clearly, leaving no room for doubt, and both contracting parties understood and had full knowledge of the same.
Private respondent however contends that the agreement providing non-liability on petitionerâs part in case of loss caused by errors or delays despite its recklessness and negligence is void for being contrary to public policy and interest.
[15]
A contract of adhesion is defined as one in which one of the parties imposes a ready-made form of contract, which the other party may accept or reject, but which the latter cannot modify.
[16]
One party prepares the stipulation in the contract, while the other party merely affixes his signature or his ""adhesion"" thereto,
[17]
giving no room for  negotiation and depriving the latter of the opportunity to bargain on equal footing.
[18]
Nevertheless, these types of contracts have been declared as binding as ordinary contracts, the reason being that the party who adheres to the contract is free to reject it entirely.
[19]
It is equally important to stress, though, that the Court is not precluded from ruling out blind adherence to their terms if the attendant facts and circumstances show that they should be ignored for being obviously too one-sided.
[20]
On previous occasions, it has been declared that a contract of adhesion may be struck down as void and unenforceable, for being subversive to public policy, only when the weaker party is imposed upon in dealing with the dominant bargaining party and is reduced to the alternative of taking it or leaving it, completely deprived of the opportunity to bargain on equal footing.
[21]
And when it has been shown that the complainant is knowledgeable enough to have understood the terms and conditions of the contract, or one whose stature is such that he is expected to be more prudent and cautious with respect to his transactions, such party cannot later on be heard to complain for being ignorant or having been forced into merely consenting to the contract.
[22]
The factual backdrop of the instant case, however, militates against applying the aforestated pronouncements.  That petitioner failed to discharge its obligation to transmit private respondentâs telegraphic transfer on time in accordance with their agreement is already a settled matter as the same is no longer disputed in this petition.  Neither is the finding of respondent Court of Appeals that petitioner acted fraudulently and in bad faith in the performance of its obligation, being contested by petitioner.  Perforce, we are bound by these factual considerations.
Having established that petitioner acted fraudulently and in bad faith, we find it implausible to absolve petitioner from its wrongful acts on account of the assailed provision exempting it from any liability.  In
Geraldez vs. Court of Appeals,
[23]
it was unequivocally declared that notwithstanding the enforceability of a contractual limitation, responsibility arising from a fraudulent act cannot be exculpated because the same is contrary to public policy. Indeed, Article 21 of the Civil Code is quite explicit in providing that ""[a]ny person who willfully causes loss or injury to another in a manner that is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy shall compensate the latter for the damage."" Freedom of contract is subject to the limitation that the agreement must not be against public policy and any agreement or contract made in violation of this rule is not binding and will not be enforced.
[24]
The prohibition against this type of contractual stipulation is moreover treated by law as void which may not be ratified or waived by a contracting party.  Article 1409 of the Civil Code states:
""ART. 1409. The following contracts are inexistent and void from the beginning:
(1) Those whose cause, object or purpose is contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy;
xxx    xxx      xxx
These contracts cannot be ratified. Neither can the right to set up the defense of illegality be waived.""
Undoubtedly, the services being offered by a banking institution like petitioner are imbued with public interest.
[25]
The use of telegraphic transfers have now become commonplace among businessmen because it facilitates commercial transactions. Any attempt to completely exempt one of the contracting parties from any liability in case of loss notwithstanding its bad faith, fault or negligence, as in the instant case, cannot be sanctioned for being inimical to public interest and therefore contrary to public policy. Resultingly, there being no dispute that petitioner acted fraudulently and in bad faith, the award of moral
[26]
and exemplary damages were proper.
But notwithstanding petitionerâs liability for the resulting loss and damage to private respondent, we find the amount of moral damages adjudged by respondent court in the sum of P400,000.00 exorbitant.  Bearing in mind that moral damages are awarded, not to penalize the wrongdoer, but rather to compensate the claimant for the injuries that he may have suffered,
[27]
we believe that an award of Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P200,000.00) is reasonable under the circumstances.
WHEREFORE,
subject to the foregoing modification reducing the amount awarded as moral damages to the sum of Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P200,000.00), the appealed decision is hereby
AFFIRMED.
SO ORDERED.

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROMEO REDULOSA ALIAS ROMEO SOLON AND MICMIC REDULOSA ALIAS MICMIC SOLON AND ROSELO CARTON, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.
R E S O L U T I O N
MENDOZA, J.:
This case is here on appeal from the judgment of the Regional  Trial Court of Cebu City, finding appellant Romeo Redulosa and his co-accused Roselo Carton guilty of kidnapping for ransom with murder and sentencing each of them to death. The decision of the trial court was rendered before the present Constitution (which prohibits the imposition of the death penalty) took effect on February 2, 1987. The question is whether the appellant can withdraw the appeal. For reasons to be hereafter explained, we hold that the appeal can be withdrawn.
The facts are as follows:
Appellant Romeo Redulosa (alias ""Micmic Redulosa,"" ""Romeo Solon"" and ""Micmic Solon"") and Roselo Carton were accused of kidnapping for ransom with murder. The information alleged:
That on or about the 3rd day of December, 1981, at about 8:00 oâclock A.M., and for sometime subsequent thereto, in the City of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, armed with a deadly weapon, with the use of a motor vehicle, conniving and confederating together and mutually helping with each other, with deliberate intent, did then and there kidnap or detain one Christopher Jason Tan, aged 9 years, or deprive him of his liberty by bringing him to Tan-awan, Carcar, Cebu, and at the same time demanding money in the amount of P100,000.00 from the parents of said Christopher Jason Tan as ransom for the liberty of said Christopher Jason Tan, and upon failure of said parents to come up with the full amount of P 100,000.00, with deliberate intent and intent to kill, with treachery, abuse of superior strength, evident premeditation, and in disregard the respect due the offended party on account of his age, did then and there stab with the use of a bladed weapon aforesaid Christopher Jason Tan several times on different parts of his body, thereby inflicting upon him the following injuries:
""STAB WOUNDS ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY:
as a consequence of which said Christopher Jason Tan died.
CONTRARY TO LAW.""
During the trial, a witness for the prosecution, Noel Tano, testified that Redulosa proposed that they kidnap Christopher Jason Tan, the son of Luisita and Tomas Tan. Tano, a former army man, was a security guard at Southwestern University.  Luisita Tan is a first cousin of Romeo Redulosa.  The boy, Christopher Jason Tan, then nine years of age, was a student of the Sacred Heart School for Boys.  Appellant also included Roselo Carton in the plan.
The first two attempts to lure the boy out of the campus (on the pretext that his parents wanted to see him) failed.  Noel Tano, who was assigned to get the boy, was stricken by conscience, but was prevailed upon to stay with the two in the third attempt to kidnap the boy in the following manner:
Redulosa would drive a taxicab which he would bump against Tomas Tanâs car.  The group would then alight from the car and, by pretending to be military men, scare the father.  In the ensuing panic and confusion, Tano and Carton would snatch the child.  This third attempt also failed. After that, Noel Tano said, he dropped out of appellantâs plan.
Tomas Tan testified that in the morning of December 3, 1981, a man phoned him demanding P 100,000.00 ransom for the safe return of his son Jason who had been kidnapped earlier that morning.  Because Tomas Tan said he could not raise the amount on such short notice, the amount was reduced to P15,000.00.  The money was to be left inside Tomas Tanâs car which should be parked near the Taoist Temple, at around noon.
At around 2 P.M. the caller phoned again and said he was not able to get the money.  He asked Tomas Tan to be ready with P50,000.00 for Jasonâs release, saying that he would call again after five days but he never did.
The matter was reported to the police and was eventually referred to the investigation team headed by PC Technical Sgt. Godofredo Lucasan.  Lucasan testified that they were able to pick up Noel Tano who pointed to appellant as the possible kidnapper.  After his apprehension, appellant executed an extra-judicial confession and implicated Roselo Carton who was soon arrested.  Appellant led the police to a place where Jasonâs body was found in an advanced stage of decomposition.  The remains were identified by means of the dental records of the boy.
In his defense, Redulosa alleged that the mastermind was really a certain Sonny who belonged to the military and who had been introduced to him by Noel Tano.  Redulosa testified that Sonny thought the boyâs father was a millionaire as a result of insurance fraud and arson wherein Sonnyâs relative, a certain Alfredo Suico, was used as a ""firebug"" and then killed to make sure he did not talk.  Sonny proposed the kidnapping of Tomas Tanâs only son Jason as a revenge and as a way to make easy money.
Redulosa claimed that he agreed because Sonny had threatened to kill his wife and family. On December 3, 1981, after coming from the hospital where he had taken his wife, who is a physician, Redulosa was stopped by Sonny and Noel Tano.  They got into his car and at gunpoint ordered him to proceed to the Sacred Heart School.  Noel Tano went inside the school compound and after five minutes came back with Jason in tow.  The group then proceeded to Redulosaâs residence at San Isidro, Talisay, Cebu.  From there Noel Tano called the boyâs father.  When Noel Tano noticed that Redulosa was taping the telephone conversation, he ordered Redulosa to get out of the room.  (Accused presented the tape during trial but what was heard was only the voice of Jason pleading with his father to pay ransom.) Redulosa claimed that he tried to leave to report the matter to the police, but Sonny overtook him and ordered him to turn back.
At 10:30 in the morning, the group returned to Cebu City and were proceeding to Tabunoc when Jason complained that he was hungry.  Appellant suggested that they take lunch in his residence. The group afterward proceeded to Tabunoc where Sonny stopped Redulosaâs car and had Jason transferred to his (Sonnyâs) Toyota.
Somewhere in Carcar, Sonny told Redulosa to leave everything to him and to go back to Cebu City. He did not hear from Sonny again until seven days later.  He was told that Tomas Tan had failed to pay the full amount of ransom. Appellant Redulosa was assured that his nephew was safe.  Redulosa was arrested by the police on December 25, 1981 for the kidnapping of his nephew.
On October 3, 1983 the RTC, then presided over by Judge Regino Hermosisima, Jr., now a member of this Court, rendered judgment finding appellant Redulosa and Carton guilty of the charge, with the aggravating circumstance of treachery, evident premeditation and use of a motor vehicle. The trial court found:
Witnesses Panfila Obado and Jerry Belonta, domestic servants in the household of Romeo Redulosa, wittingly or unwittingly, but truthfully testified against their master to the effect that their said master, Romeo Redulosa, and Roselo Carton had brought Christopher Jason Tan to the Redulosa residence at around 9:00 oâclock in the morning of December 3, 1981.
Redulosa and Carton locked themselves inside Redulosaâs room with the child. Redulosa had first transferred the telephone from the sala to his bedroom.
Romeo Redulosa timed the bringing of the child to the house in such a way that neither his wife nor his parents-in-law would be present in the house.
The servants must have found it unusual for Romeo Redulosa to be bringing to the house Christopher Jason Tan, along with a stranger, without the childâs parents so early in the morning of a school day.
Both accused had kept the child locked up in Redulosaâs room from the moment they arrived up to 2:30 oâclock in the afternoon.  The child realized that he was being kidnapped because he was deathly pale, frantic and was ready to cry, but he must have been given the impression that Romeo Redulosa was there to protect him, for every time Redulosa leaves him, the poor boy calls after him, ""Donât leave me, Tio.""
On the other hand, neither Romeo Redulosa nor Roselo Carton appeared harassed or frightened. No guns were poked at them to compel them to do what they were doing.  They had the situation well in hand. Redulosa was the one who ordered the servants to cook lunch not only for him but also for Roselo Carton and the boy.
While Roselo Carton from all appearances was the subservient menial of Romeo Redulosa, his role while in the house having been to guard the boy and prevent him from escaping, Romeo Redulosa showed every sign of being the boss directing the operation.  He caused the transfer of the telephone from a corner of the living room to his bedroom, the better to make call without being heard by the servants.
Since Carton and he and the child were holed up in the room for one hour and Redulosa hurriedly left the room and went out of the house in a frenzy after that, - and it was in between this period of time that the boyâs father, Tomas Tan, received the phone call asking for ransom for his kidnapped son, - there can be no other conclusion from these facts than that Romeo Redulosa was the one who made the call to Tomas Tan then.
Romeo Redulosa, far from being a captive or a person restrained, appeared to be the leader. He was the one who gave orders and he went in and out of the house at his pleasure.
That Romeo Redulosa and Roselo Carton did bring Christopher Jason Tan out of Redulosaâs house at 2:30 oâclock that same afternoon on the way south where the child was brutally and senselessly killed, makes it a foregone conclusion that Romeo Redulosa and Roselo Carton killed, or cooperated with each other in killing, the boy, whoever did the actual stabbing.
Romeo Redulosa and Roselo Carton were sentenced to death and ordered to indemnify the victimâs heirs in the amount of P50,000.00, and to pay P 100,000.00 by way of moral and exemplary damages, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and the costs. Thereafter the case was brought to this Court on automatic review.
On December 16, 1983, Carton escaped from the Bagong Buhay Rehabilitation Center, Lahug, Cebu City. For this reason the Court, in its resolution of September 22, 1993, dismissed Cartonâs appeal pursuant to Rule 124, Â§ 8 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure.
On the other hand, On March 22, 1995, appellant sent from his prison cell at the Bureau of Corrections an ""Urgent Motion to Withdraw Appeal."" As no reason was given for the motion and it was made without the assistance of counsel, the Court required Atty. Froilan Valdez of the Public Attorneyâs Office, to comment on the motion.
In his comment filed on August 17, 1995, Atty. Valdez stated that appellantâs decision to withdraw was voluntarily made, with full understanding of the consequences of his action.  Atty. Valdez stated that appellant ""deserves sympathy as well as release from confinement sooner or later"" considering that he has already suffered 14 years of imprisonment and that he has been trying his best to reform.
For his part the Solicitor General said he found no valid reason to interpose objection to the appellantâs motion.
After due deliberation the Court resolved to grant appellantâs motion to withdraw his appeal. To begin with the death penalty imposed on appellant was automatically reduced to reclusion perpetua in view of Art. III, Â§ 19(1). of the Constitution which took effect on February 2, 1987. While this case was brought to this Court for automatic review as required by Rule 122, Â§ 9 of the Rules of Court, the case has ceased to be in this Court by virtue of such Rule.  As a matter of fact appellant had to file a notice of appeal on August 20, 1990, otherwise he would be taken as having given his assent to his conviction on the basis of the reduced sentence and his case would be remanded to the trial court for execution of its decision as modified with respect to the penalty which is reduced to
reclusion perpetua.
Thus, in its resolution dated April 30, 1987, in Administrative Matter No. 87-5-3173-0, this Court ruled:
(1) that notices be given to all the accused in the pending cases before the Court wherein the death penalty has been imposed, advising said accused that the death penalty imposed upon them has been officially commuted to
reclusion perpetua
(life imprisonment) by virtue of the abolition of the death penalty under the 1987 Constitution and that with such abolition of the death penalty their cases are no longer subject to automatic review by this Court, and
(2) to GRANT said accused a period of thirty (30) days from notice within which to file a written statement, personally signed by them with the assistance of their counsel, stating whether or not they wish to continue with their said cases as an appealed case.
(a) If they file such statement that they wish to continue with this Courtâs reviewing their conviction as an appealed case, the Court will do so, rendering a judgment of affirmance, modification of the penalty or reversal as may be warranted by the evidence and applicable law; and
(b) If they file a statement that they are satisfied with the judgment of the trial court whose death penalty has now been commuted to
reclusion perpetua,
or if they fail to file any statement within the 30-day period herein given, the Court will dismiss the case and remand the same to the trial court for execution of judgment.
This ruling is now embodied in Circular No. 9 dated May 20, 1987 of this Court.  Consequently this case has remained in this Court only because of appellantâs decision to continue his case as an appealed case.  However, as appellant had the right to continue with his case as an appealed one, so does he have a right - subject to the approval of this Court - to terminate the appeal by withdrawing it.
[1]
Both the appellantâs counsel and the Solicitor General urge approval of appellantâs motion.
Nor is this right of appellant to withdraw his appeal affected by the enactment of R.A. No. 7659 which took effect on December 31, 1993,
[2]
providing for the reimposition of the death penalty in cases of heinous crimes including the one for which appellant was sentenced to death (kidnapping for ransom with murder).  The new law does not apply to crimes committed prior to its effectivity.
[3]
Indeed, this situation was precisely anticipated by the Constitutional Commission as shown by the following:
[4]
MR. BENGZON. I also have a question, Madam President.
THE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Bengzon is recognized.
MR. BENGZON. If the amendment of Commissioner Monsod is passed, the death penalties already imposed will be committed [sic] to reclusion perpetua, will it not?
MR. MONSOD. Yes.
MR. BENGZON. And then, supposing Congress passes a law imposing the death penalty on those very same crimes committed by those that were convicted of the death penalty which penalty has been commuted to reclusion perpetua, will they go back?
MR. MONSOD. No.
MR. BENGZON. Not anymore?
MR. MONSOD. Any new law [reimposing the death penalty] passed by the National Assembly would be prospective in character.
MR. BENGZON. Thank you.
FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS,
the Court
RESOLVED
to
GRANT
appellant Romeo Redulosaâs motion and to
DISMISS
his appeal.  The case is
REMANDED
to the trial court for execution of its decision with the modification that the penalty of death therein imposed is reduced to reclusion perpetua.
SO ORDERED.

Compare the withdrawal of appeal in lower courts as provided in Rule 122, Â§ 12 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure:
Notwithstanding the perfection of the appeal, the Municipal Trial Court, Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Metropolitan Trial Court, Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Metropolitan Trial Court or Regional Trial Court may allow the appellant to withdraw his appeal before the record has been forwarded by the clerk of court to the proper appellate court as provided in Section 8, in which case the judgment shall become final. The Regional Trial Court may also, in its discretion. allow the appellant from the judgment of a Municipal Trial Court, Municipal Circuit Trial Court, or Metropolitan Trial Court to withdraw his appeal, provided a motion to that effect is filed before judgment of the case on appeal, in which case the judgment of the court a quo shall become final and the case shall be remanded to the court a quo for execution of the judgment.

MARCOPPER MINING CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND NATIONAL MINES AND ALLIED WORKERSâ UNION (NAMAWU-MIF), RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N
KAPUNAN, J.:
Social justice and full protection to labor guaranteed by the fundamental law of this land is not some romantic notion, high in rhetoric but low in substance.  The case at bench provides yet another example of harmonizing and balancing the ""right of labor to its just share in the fruits of production and the right of enterprises to reasonable returns on investments, and to expansion and growth.""
[1]
In this petition for certiorari and prohibition under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, Marcopper Mining Corporation impugns the decision rendered by the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) on 18 November 1991 in RAB-IV-12-2588-88 dismissing petitionerâs appeal, and the resolution issued by the said tribunal dated 20 December 1991 denying petitionerâs motion for reconsideration.
There is no disagreement as to the following facts:
On 23 August 1984, Marcopper Mining Corporation, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines, engaged in the business of mineral prospecting, exploration and extraction, and private respondent NAMAWU-MIF, a labor federation duly organized and registered with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), to which the Marcopper Employees Union (the exclusive bargaining agent of all rank-and-file workers of petitioner) is affiliated, entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) effective from 1 May 1984 until 30 April 1987.
Sec. 1, Art. V of the said Collective Bargaining Agreement provides:
Section 1.  The COMPANY agrees to grant general wage increase to all employees within the bargaining unit as follows:
Effectivity
Increase per day on the Basic Wage
May 1,1985
5%
May 1,1986
5%
It is expressly understood that this wage increase shall be exclusive of any increase in the minimum wage and/or mandatory living allowance that may be promulgated during the life of this Agreement.
[2]
Prior to the expiration of the aforestated Agreement, on 25 July 1986, petitioner and private respondent executed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) wherein the terms of the CBA, specifically on matters of wage increase and facilities allowance, were modified as follows:
1. The COMPANY hereby grants a wage increase of 10% of the basic rate to all employees and workers within the bargaining units (sic) as follows:
(a) 5% effective May 1,1986.
This will mean that the members of the bargaining unit will get an effective increase of 10% from May 1, 1986.
(b)
5% effective May 1,1987.
2. The COMPANY hereby grants an increase of the facilities allowance from P50.00 to P100.00 per month effective May 1, 1986.
[3]
In compliance with the amended CBA, petitioner implemented the initial 5% wage increase due on 1 May 1986.
[4]
On 1 June 1987, Executive Order (E.O.) No. 178 was promulgated mandating the integration of the cost of living allowance under Wage Orders Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 into the basic wage of workers, its effectivity retroactive to 1 May 1987.
[5]
Consequently, effective on 1 May 1987, the basic wage rate of petitionerâs laborers categorized as non-agricultural workers was increased by P9.00 per day.
[6]
Petitioner implemented the second five percent (5%) wage increase due on 1 May 1987 and thereafter added the integrated COLA.
[7]
Private respondent, however, assailed the manner in which the second wage increase was effected.  It argued that the COLA should first be integrated into the basic wage before the 5% wage increase is computed.
[8]
Consequently, on 15 December 1988, the union filed a complaint for underpayment of wages before the Regional Arbitration Branch IV, Quezon City.
On 24 July 1989, the Labor Arbiter promulgated a decision in favor of the union.  The dispositive part reads, thus:
WHEREFORE, consistent with the tenor hereof, judgment is rendered directing respondent company to pay the wage differentials due its rank-and-file workers retroactive to 1 May 1987.
SO ORDERED.
[9]
The Labor Arbiter ruled in this wise:
First and foremost, the written instrument and the intention of the parties must be brought to the fore.  And talking of intention, we conjure to sharp focus the provision embossed in Section 1, Article V of the collective agreement, viz:

It is expressly understood that this wage increase shall be exclusive of increase in the minimum wage and/or mandatory living allowance that may be promulgated during the life of this Agreement. (Italics ours.)
The foregoing phrase albeit innocuously framed offers the cue.  This ushers us to the inner sanctum of what really was the intention of the parties to the contract.  Treading along its lines, it becomes readily discernible that this portion of the contract is the ""stop-lock"" gate or known in its technical term as the ""non-chargeability"" clause.  There can be no quibbling that on the strength of this provision, the wage/allowance granted under this accord cannot be credited to similar form of benefit that may be thereafter ordained by the government through legislation.  That the parties therefore were consciously aware at the time of the conclusion of the agreement of the never-ending rise in the cost of living is a logical corollary.  And while this upward trend may not be a welcome phenomenon, there was the intention to yield and comply in the event of an imposition.  Of course, there cannot likewise be any rivalry that if the Executive Order were to retroact to 2 May 1987 or a day after the last contractual increase, this question will not arise.  It is in this sense of fairness that we cannot allow this ""one (1) day"" to be an insulating medium to deny the workers the benediction endowed by Executive Order No. 178.
[10]
Petitioner appealed the Labor Arbiterâs decision and on 18 November 1991 the NLRC rendered its decision sustaining the Labor Arbiterâs ruling.  The dispositive portion states:
WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Decision of the Labor Arbiter is hereby AFFIRMED and the appeal filed is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.
SO ORDERED.
[11]
The NLRC declared:
x x x Increments to the laborersâ financial gratification, be they in the form of salary increases or changes in the salary scale are aimed at one thing -improvement of the economic predicament of the laborers.  As such, they should be viewed in the light of the Stateâs avowed policy to protect labor. Thus, having entered into an agreement with its employees, an employer may not be allowed to renege on its obligation under a collective bargaining agreement should, at the same time, the law grants the employees the same or better terms and conditions of employment.  Employee benefits derived from law are exclusive of benefits arrived at through negotiation and agreement unless otherwise provided by the agreement itself or by law. (Meycauayan College v. Hon. Franklin N. Drilon, 185 SCRA 50).
[12]
Petitionerâs motion for reconsideration was denied by the NLRC in its resolution dated 20 December 1991.
In the present petition, Marcopper challenges the NLRC decision on the following grounds:
I
PUBLIC RESPONDENT NLRC ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF LABOR ARBITER JOAQUIN TANODRA DIRECTING MARCOPPER TO PAY WAGE DIFFERENTIALS DUE ITS RANK-AND-FILE EMPLOYEES RETROACTIVE TO 1 MAY 1987 CONSIDERING THAT SANS EO 178, THE FUNDAMENTAL MEANING OF THE BASIC WAGE IS CLEARLY DIFFERENT FROM, AND DOES NOT INCLUDE THE COLA AT THE TIME THE CBA WAS ENTERED INTO. THUS, PUBLIC RESPONDENTâS READING OF THE CBA, AS AMENDED BY THE MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT DATED 25 JULY 1986, ULTIMATELY DISREGARDED THE ORDINARY MEANING OF THE PHRASE âBASIC WAGE,â OTHERWISE INTENDED BY THE PARTIES DURING THE TIME THE CBA WAS EXECUTED.
II
THE LABOR ARBITER AND PUBLIC RESPONDENT NLRCâS RELIANCE ON THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF SECTION 1, ARTICLE V OF THE CBA WHICH STATES: âIT IS EXPRESSLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WAGE INCREASE SHALL BE EXCLUSIVE OF ANY INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE AND/OR MANDATORY LIVING ALLOWANCE THAT MAY BE PROMULGATED DURING THE LIFE OF THIS AGREEMENTâ IS MISPLACED AND WITHOUT BASIS BECAUSE SAID PROVISION HARDLY OFFERS A HINT AS TO WHAT BASIC WAGE THE PARTIES HAD IN MIND AT THE TIME THEY EXECUTED THE CBA AS AMENDED BY THE MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT.
III
PETITIONER COMPUTED THE 5% WAGE INCREASE BASED ON THE UNINTEGRATED BASIC WAGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTENT AND TERMS OF THE CBA, AS AMENDED BY THE MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT. THIS WAS IN FULL ACCORD AND IN FAITHFUL COMPLIANCE WITH EO 178.  HENCE, PETITIONER DID NOT COMMIT ANY UNDERPAYMENT.
IV
THE DOCTRINE OF LIBERAL INTERPRETATION IN FAVOR OF LABOR IN CASE OF DOUBT IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE INSTANT CASE.
[13]
Stripped of the non-essentials, the question for our resolution is what should be the basis for the computation of the CBA increase, the basic wage without the COLA or the so-called ""integrated"" basic wage which, by mandate of E.O. No. 178, includes the COLA.
It is petitionerâs contention that the basic wage referred to in the CBA pertains to the ""unintegrated"" basic wage.  Petitioner maintains that the rules on interpretation of contracts, particularly Art. 1371 of the New Civil Code which states that:
Art. 1371. In order to judge the intention of the contracting parties, their contemporaneous and subsequent acts shall be principally considered.
should govern.  Accordingly, applying the aforequoted provision in the case at bench, petitioner concludes that it was clearly not the intention of the parties (petitioner and private respondent) to include the COLA in computing the CBA/MOA mandated increase since the MOA was entered into a year before E.O. No. 178 was enacted even though their effectivity dates coincide.  In other words, the situation ""contemporaneous"" to the execution of the amendatory MOA was that there was yet no law requiring the integration of the COLA into the basic wage.
[14]
Petitioner, therefore, cannot be compelled to undertake an obligation it never assumed or contemplated under the CBA or MOA.
Siding with the petitioner, the Solicitor General opines that for the purpose of complying with the obligations imposed by the CBA, the integrated COLA should not be considered due to the exclusivity of the benefits under the said CBA and E.O. No. 178. He explains thus:
A collective bargaining agreement is a contractual obligation.  It is distinct from an obligation imposed by law. The terms and conditions of a CBA constitute the law between the parties.  Thus, employee benefits derived from either the law or a contract should be treated as distinct and separate from each other. (Meycauayan College vs. Drilon, supra.)
xxx    xxx    xxx.
Very clearly, the CBA and E.O. 178 provided for the exclusiveness of the benefits to be given or awarded to the employees of petitioner.  Thus, when petitioner computed the 5% wage increase based on the unintegrated basic wage, it complied with its contractual obligations under the CBA.  When it thereafter integrated the COLA into the basic wage, it complied also with the mandate of E.O. 178. Petitioner, therefore, complied with its contractual obligations in the CBA as well as with the legal mandate of the law. Consequently, petitioner is not guilty of underpayment.
To follow the theory of private respondent, that is - to integrate first the COLA into the basic wage and thereafter compute the 5% wage increase therefrom, would violate the ""exclusiveness"" of the benefits granted under the CBA and under E.O. 178.
[15]
Private respondent counters by asserting that the purpose, nature and essence of CBA negotiation is to obtain wage increases and benefits over and above what the law provides and that the principle of non-diminution of benefits should prevail.
The NLRC, which filed its own comment, likewise, made the following assertions:
x x x However, to state outright that the parties intended the basic wage to remain invariable even after the advent of EO 178 is unfounded and presumptuous a claim as such inevitably works to the utmost disadvantage of the workers and runs counter to the constitutional guarantee of affording protection to labor.  Evidently, the rationale for the integration of the COLA with the basic wage was primarily to increase the base wage for purposes of computation of such items as overtime and premium pay, fringe benefits, etc.  To adopt the statement and claim of the petitioner would then redound to depriving the workers of the full benefits the law intended for them, which in the final analysis was solely for the purpose of alleviating their plight due to the continuous undue hardship they suffer caused by the ever escalating prices of prime commodities.
[16]
We rule for the respondents.
The principle that the CBA is the law between the contracting parties stands strong and true.
[17]
However, the present controversy involves not merely an interpretation of CBA provisions.  More importantly, it requires a determination of the effect of an executive order on the terms and the conditions of the CBA.  This is, and should be, the focus of the instant case.
It is unnecessary to delve too much on the intention of the parties as to what they allegedly meant by the term ""basic wage"" at the time the CBA and MOA were executed because there is no question that as of 1 May 1987, as mandated by E.O. No. 178, the basic wage of workers, or the statutory minimum wage, was increased with the integration of the COLA.  As of said date, then, the term ""basic wage""
includes
the COLA.  This is what the law ordains and to which the collective bargaining agreement of the parties must conform.
Petitionerâs arguments eventually lose steam in the light of the fact that compliance with the law is mandatory and beyond contractual stipulation by and between the parties; consequently, whether or not petitioner intended the basic wage to include the COLA becomes immaterial.  There is evidently nothing to construe and interpret because the law is clear and unambiguous.  Unfortunately for petitioner, said law, by some uncanny coincidence, retroactively took effect on the same date the CBA increase became effective.  Therefore, there cannot be any doubt that the computation of the CBA increase on the basis of the ""integrated"" wage does not constitute a violation of the CBA.
Petitionerâs contention that under the Rules Implementing E.O. No. 178, the definition of the term -""basic wage"" has remained unchanged is off the mark since said definition expressly allows integration of monetary benefits into the regular pay of employees:
Chapter 1. Definition of Terms and Coverage.
Section 1. Definition of Terms.
xxx    xxx      xxx.
(j) ""Basic Wage"" means all regular remuneration or earnings paid by an employer for services rendered on normal working days and hours
but does not include cost-of- living allowances, profit-sharing payments, premium payments, 13th month pay, and other monetary benefits which are not considered as part of or integrated into the regular salary of the employee on the date the Order became effective.
(Italics ours.)
What E.O. No. 178 did was exactly to integrate the COLA under Wage Orders Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 into the basic pay so as to increase the statutory daily minimum wage. Section 2 of the Rules is quite explicit:
Section 2.
Amount to be Integrated.
- Effective on the dates specified,
as a result of the integration, the basic wage rate of covered workers shall be increased by the following amounts:
(Italics ours.)
xxx    xxx    xxx.
Integration of monetary benefits into the basic pay of workers is not a new method of increasing the minimum wage.
[18]
But even so, we are still guided by our ruling in
Davao Integrated Port Stevedoring Services v. Abarquez,
[19]
which we herein reiterate:
While the terms and conditions of the CBA constitute the law between the parties, it is not, however, an ordinary contract to which is applied the principles of law governing ordinary contracts.  A CBA, as a labor contract within the contemplation of Article 1700 of the Civil Code of the Philippines which governs the relations between labor and capital, is not merely contractual in nature but impressed with public interest, thus, it must yield to the common good. As such, it must be construed liberally rather than narrowly and technically, and the courts must place a practical and realistic construction upon it, giving due consideration to the context in which it is negotiated and purpose which it is intended to serve.
Finally, petitioner misinterprets the declaration of the Labor Arbiter in the assailed decision that ""when the pendulum of judgment swings to and fro and the forces are equal on both sides, the same must be stilled in favor of labor."" While petitioner acknowledges that all doubts in the interpretation of the Labor Code shall be resolved in favor of labor,
[20]
it insists that what is involved-here is the amended CBA which is essentially a contract between private persons. What petitioner has lost sight of is the avowed policy of the State, enshrined in our Constitution, to accord utmost protection and justice to labor, a policy, we are, likewise, sworn to uphold.
In
Philippine Telegraph & Telephone Corporation v. NLRC,
[21]
we categorically stated that:
When conflicting interests of labor and capital are to be weighed on the scales of social justice, the heavier influence of the latter should be counter-balanced by sympathy and compassion the law must accord the underprivileged worker.
Likewise, in
Terminal Facilities and Services Corporation v. NLRC,
[22]
we declared:
Any doubt concerning the rights of labor should be resolved in its favor pursuant to the social justice policy.
The purpose of E.O. No. 178 is to improve the lot of the workers covered by the said statute. We are bound to ensure its fruition.
WHEREFORE,
premises considered, the petition is hereby DISMISSED.
SO ORDERED.

REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF APPEALS, HEIRS OF IRENE BULLUNGAN, REPRESENTED BY HER HUSBAND DOMINGO PAGGAO AND THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF ISABELA, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N
MENDOZA, J.:
This is a petition for review of the decision
[1]
of the Court of Appeals reversing the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch XIX,
[2]
Cauayan, Isabela declaring Free Patent No. V-79740 and Original Certificate of Title No. P-88 17 in the name of Irene Bullungan null and void so far as the portion of Lot No. 1, Psu- 150801 involved in this case is concerned.
The facts of this case are as follows:
On September 10, 1955, Irene Bullungan (now deceased) applied for a free patent covering lots situated in Fugaru (now San Guillermo), Angadanan, Isabela.  The lots included a portion of Lot No. 1, Psu-150801, between Lot No. 763 and Lot No. 764, consisting of 1.04 hectares, which Vicente Carabbacan claimed.  In her application, Irene Bullungan stated that the land applied for by her was not claimed or occupied by any other person and that it was public land which had been continuously occupied and cultivated by her since 1925.
[3]
Upon certification of Assistant Public Land Inspector Jose M. Telmo at Ilagan, Isabela that Irene Bullungan had been in actual, continuous, open, notorious, exclusive and adverse possession of the land since 1925, the Director of Lands approved Bullunganâs application on June 4, 1957.  On December 26, 1957, Original Certificate of Title No. P-8817 was issued in the name of Irene Bullungan.
Alleging that a portion of Lot No. 1, Psu-150801 covered by the free patent issued to Irene Bullungan overlapped the lot between Lot No. 763 and Lot No. 764, which he was occupying, Vicente Carrabacan filed a protest on September 7, 1961.  The District Land Officer at Ilagan, Isabela recommended the dismissal of the protest on the ground that the Bureau of Lands no longer had jurisdiction over the matter as a result of the grant of a free patent to Irene Bullungan.  But the Director of Lands on March 23, 1982 ordered an investigation of the protest.
Vicente Carabbacan also brought an action for the reconveyance of the portion of Lot No. 1, Psu-150801 and the cancellation of free patent against Irene Bullungan on September 5, 1961, although this was dismissed by the court without prejudice.
The heirs of Irene Bullungan in turn sought to recover possession of the land in an action which they brought in the Court of First Instance of Isabela on April 13, 1972. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. Br. II-1102.  On the other hand, refusing to give up his claim, Vicente Carabbacan filed a case for reconveyance on August 15, 1972, which was docketed as Civil Case No. 1108.  The cases were thereafter tried jointly.
On November 22, 1972 the court rendered a decision, dismissing the complaint of Vicente Carabbacan and ordering him to vacate the land, even as it upheld the ownership of Irene Bullungan.  Carabbacan, who had been in possession of the land in question, was finally ousted on December 10, 1981.
As already stated, the Director of Lands ordered on March 23, 1982 an investigation of Carabbacanâs protest.  The investigation was undertaken by Senior Special Investigator Napoleon R. Dulay, who found that Vicente Carabbacan had been in actual cultivation of the land identified as Lot No. 763, Pls-594 since 1947, having acquired the same from Tomas Tarayao on May 4, 1947.  In his report dated September 17, 1985, the land investigator stated that due to a big flood which occurred in December 1947, the Cagayan River changed its course by moving north-east, resulting in the emergence of a piece of land, which is the subject of this dispute. Carrabacan took possession of the land and cultivated it.  He was in the continuous, peaceful, open and adverse occupation and cultivation of the land from December 1947 until 1981 when he was ejected by virtue of the decision in Civil Cases No. 1088 and 11102.
[4]
Based on these findings, the Chief of the Legal Division of the Bureau of Lands recommended on March 10, 1986 that steps be taken to seek the amendment of Free Patent No. V-79740 and Original Certificate of Title No. P-8817 of the late Irene Bullungan so as to exclude the disputed portion and for the reversion of the same to the State.
On November 28, 1986, the Solicitor General filed in behalf of the Republic of the Philippines a complaint for the cancellation of Free Patent No. V- 79740 and OCT No. P-8817 on the ground of fraud and misrepresentation in obtaining the free patent.  The case was filed in the Regional Trial Court of Cauayan, Isabela which, on September 25, 1989, rendered a decision declaring Free Patent No. V-79740 and OCT No. P-8817 null and void insofar as the portion of Lot No. 1, Psu-150801 between Lot No. 763 and Lot No. 764, is concerned.  The lower court found that Irene Bullungan made misrepresentations by claiming in her application for a free patent that she was in possession of the disputed portion of Lot No. 1, Psu-150801, when in fact Vicente Carabbacan was occupying and cultivating the land.  The court justified the reversion of the land in question as an assertion of ""a governmental right.""
On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals reversed the lower courtâs ruling on the ground that, after the lapse of one year from the date of issuance of the patent, the State could no longer bring an action for reversion.  The appellate court held that the certificate of title issued in the name of Irene Bullungan became incontrovertible and indefeasible upon the lapse of one year from the issuance of the free patent.
The Republic controverts the ruling of the Court of Appeals.  It contends that the doctrine of indefeasibility of Torrens Titles does not bar the filing of an action for cancellation of title and reversion of land even if more than one year has elapsed from the issuance of the free patent in case of fraud in obtaining patents.
We agree with petitioner. To begin with, there is no question that Free Patent No. 79740 and Original Certificate of Title P-8817 were obtained through fraud.  The trial court found that Irene Bullungan falsely stated in her application for a free patent that Lot No. 1, Psu-150801 was not claimed or occupied by any other person.  The trial court found that a portion of the lot in question had been in the possession and cultivation of Vicente Carabbacan since December 1947.
[5]
Indeed private respondents admit that before Irene Bullungan filed her application for a free patent, she had filed a complaint for forcible entry against Vicente Carrabacan.  The complaint, which was filed in the Justice of the Peace Court of Angadanan, Isabela, was dismissed precisely because the court found that Carabbacan had been in possession of the land long before it was sold to Irene Bullungan by Leonida Tarayao.
[6]
The Court of Appeals did not disturb the trial courtâs finding in this case that Irene Bullungan committed fraud and misrepresentation.  Its decision rests solely on the ground that after the lapse of one year from the date of issuance of a free patent an action for the cancellation of patent and title on ground of fraud and misrepresentation can no longer be maintained.
We think that this is error.  It is settled that once a patent is registered under Act No. 496 (now P.D. No. 1529) and the corresponding certificate of title is issued, the land ceases to be part of the public domain and becomes private property over which the Director of Lands will no longer have either control or jurisdiction.
[7]
The Torrens Title issued on the basis of a free patent or homestead patent becomes as indefeasible as one which was judicially secured upon the expiration of one year from date of issuance of patent as provided in P.D. No. 1529, Â§ 32 (formerly Act No. 496, Â§ 38).  However, as held in
Director of Lands v. De Luna,
[8]
even after the lapse of one year, the State may still bring an action under Â§ 101
[9]
of the Public Land Act for the reversion to the public domain of lands which have been fraudulently granted to private individuals.  This has been the consistent ruling of this Court.
[10]
The failure of Irene Bullungan to disclose that Vicente Carrabacan was in possession of the portion of land in dispute constitutes fraud and misrepresentation and is a ground for annulling her title.
[11]
Thus Â§ 91 of the Public Land Act provides:
Â§ 91. The statements made in the application shall be considered as essential conditions and parts of any concession, title, or permit issued on the basis of such application, and any false statement therein or omission of facts altering, changing, or modifying the consideration of the facts set forth in such statements, and any subsequent modification, alteration, or change of the material facts set forth in the application shall
ipso facto
produce the cancellation of the concession, title, or permit granted. It shall be the duty of the Director of Lands, from time to time and whenever he may deem it advisable, to make the necessary investigations for the purpose of ascertaining whether the material facts set out in the application are true, or whether they continue to exist and are maintained and preserved in good faith, and for the purpose of such investigation, the Director of Lands is hereby empowered to issue
subpoenas
and
subpoenas duces tecum
and, if necessary, to obtain compulsory process from the courts. In every investigation made in accordance with this section, the existence of bad faith, fraud, concealment, or fraudulent and illegal modification of essential facts shall be presumed if the grantee or possessor of the land shall refuse or fail to obey a
subpoena
or
subpoena duces tecum
lawfully issued by the Director of Lands or his authorized delegates or agents, or shall refuse or fail. to give direct and specific answers to pertinent questions, and on the basis of such presumption, an order of cancellation may issue out further proceedings.
The appellate court said in its decision:
We are not, of course, unaware of cases where the patent and the certificate of title issued pursuant thereto were declared null and void notwithstanding the expiration of the aforementioned period of one (1) year simply because of false statement of material and essential facts made in the application therefor.  Be it noted, however, that in these cases the lots patented or granted were no longer part of the public domain but private ones segregated from the mass thereof.  Consequently, no right whatsoever was awarded in said cases for it is already settled that a free patent which purports to convey land to which the government did not have any title at the time of its issuance does not vest any title in the patentee as against the true owner (Suva v. Ventura, 40 O.G. 8, 4th sup. August 23, 1941; Vital v. Anore, 90 Phil. 855; Director of Lands v. Abanilla, G.R. No. L-26324, August 31, 1983).  This does not obtain in the present case for it is beyond dispute that the subject land was still a part of the public domain when the same was patented by the Government in favor of appellantsâ predecessor in interest.  Accordingly, there was indeed a title awarded such that when the same was brought under operation of Land Registration Act in 1957, it became incontrovertible in 1958.
[12]
This is not so. Where public land is acquired by an applicant through fraud and misrepresentation, as in the case at bar, the State may institute reversion proceedings even after the lapse of the one-year period.
Nor is there merit in the claim of private respondents that the action taken by the Republic in this case is ""not in keeping with the policy of State to foster families as the factors of society, to give them a sense. of protection and permanency in their homes.""
[13]
Public policy demands that one who obtains title to a public land through fraud should not be allowed to benefit therefrom.  Vicente Carabbacan had been in possession of the land even. before Irene Bullungan bought the possessory rights to the land.  It was therefore a misrepresentation for her to state in her application for a free patent that she had been in possession of the lot in question when the fact is that Carabbacan had been there ahead of her.

[ G.R. No. 109972, April 29, 1996 ]
ZOSIMA VERDAD, PETITIONER, VS. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, SOCORRO C. ROSALES, AURORA ROSALES, NAPOLEON ROSALES, ANTONIO ROSALES, FLORENDA ROSALES, ELENA ROSALES AND VIRGINIA ROSALES, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N
VITUG, J.:
The petitioner, Zosima Verdad, is the purchaser of a 248-square meter residential lot (identified to be Lot No. 529, Ts-65 of the Butuan Cadastre, located along Magallanes Street, now Marcos M. Calo St., Butuan City). Private respondent, Socorro Cordero Vda. de Rosales, seeks to exercise a right of legal redemption over the subject property and traces her title to the late Macaria Atega, her mother-in-law, who died intestate on 08 March 1956.
During her lifetime, Macaria contracted two marriages: the first with Angel Burdeos and the second, following the latterâs death, with Canuto Rosales. At the time of her own death, Macaria was survived by her son Ramon A. Burdeos and her grandchild (by her daughter Felicidad A. Burdeos) Estela Lozada of the first marriage and her children of the second marriage, namely, David Rosales, Justo Rosales, Romulo Rosales, and Aurora Rosales.
Socorro Rosales is the widow of David Rosales who himself, some time after Macariaâs death, died intestate without an issue.
In an instrument, dated 14 June 1982, the heirs of Ramon Burdeos, namely, his widow Manuela Legaspi Burdeos and children Felicidad and Ramon, Jr., sold to petitioner Zosima Verdad (their interest on) the disputed lot supposedly for the price of P55,460.00. In a duly notarized deed of sale, dated 14 November 1982, it would appear, however, that the lot was sold for only P23,000.00. Petitioner explained that the second deed was intended merely to save on the tax on capital gains.
Socorro discovered the sale on 30 March 1987 while she was at the City Treasurerâs Office. On 31 March 1987, she sought the intervention of the Lupong Tagapayapa of Barangay 9, Princess Urduja, for the redemption of the property. She tendered the sum of P23,000.00 to Zosima. The latter refused to accept the amount for being much less than the lotâs current value of P80,000.00. No settlement having been reached before the Lupong Tagapayapa, private respondents, on 16 October 1987, initiated against petitioner an action for ""Legal Redemption with Preliminary Injunction"" before the Regional Trial Court of Butuan City.
On 29 June 1990, following the reception of evidence, the trial court handed down its decision holding, in fine, that private respondentsâ right to redeem the property had already lapsed.
An appeal to the Court of Appeals was interposed by private respondents. the appellate court, in its decision of 22 April 1993, reversed the court
a quo;
thus:
""WHEREFORE, premises considered, the judgment appealed from is hereby REVERSED, and a new one is accordingly entered declaring plaintiff-appellant, Socorro C. Rosales, entitled to redeem the inheritance rights (Art. 1088, NCC) or pro indiviso share (Art. 1620, NCC) of the Heirs of Ramon Burdeos, Sr. in Lot 529, Ts-65 of the Butuan Cadastre, within the remaining ELEVEN (11) DAYS from finality hereon, unless written notice of the sale and its terms are received in the interim, under the same terms and conditions appearing under Exhibit âJâ and after returning the purchase price of P23,000.00 within the foregoing period. No cost.""
[1]
In her recourse to this Court, petitioner assigned the following ""errors:"" That -
""The Honorable Court of Appeals erred in declaring Socorro C. Rosales is entitled to redeem the inheritance rights (Article 1088, NCC) or pro-indiviso share (Article 1620, NCC) of the heirs of Ramon Burdeos, Sr. in Lot 529, Ts-65 of the Butuan Cadastre, for being contrary to law and evidence.
""The Honorable Court of Appeals erred in ignoring the peculiar circumstance, in that, the respondentsâ actual knowledge, as a factor in the delay constitutes laches.
""The Honorable Court of Appeals erred in concluding that Socorro C. Rosales, in effect, timely exercised the right of legal redemption when referral to Barangay by respondent signifies bonafide intention to redeem and; that, redemption is properly made even if there is no offer of redemption in legal tender.
""The Honorable Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the running of the statutory redemption period is stayed upon commencement of Barangay proceedings.""
[2]
Still, the thrust of the petition before us is the alleged incapacity of private respondent Socorro C. Rosales to redeem the property, she being merely the spouse of David Rosales, a son of Macaria, and not being a co-heir herself in the intestate estate of Macaria.
We rule that Socorro can. It is true that Socorro, a daughter-in-law (or, for that matter, a mere relative by affinity), is not an intestate heir of her parents-in-law;
[3]
however, Socorroâ s right to the property is not because she rightfully can claim heirship in Macariaâs estate but that she is a legal heir of her husband, David Rosales, part of whose estate is a share in his motherâs inheritance.
David Rosales, incontrovertibly, survived his motherâs death. When Macaria died on 08 March 1956 her estate passed on to her surviving children, among them David Rosales, who thereupon became co-owners of the property. When David Rosales himself later died, his own estate, which included his
undivided
interest over the property inherited from Macaria, passed on to his widow Socorro and her co-heirs pursuant to the law on succession.
""ART. 995. In the absence of legitimate descendants and ascendants, and illegitimate children and their descendants, whether legitimate or illegitimate, the surviving spouse shall inherit the entire estate, without prejudice to the rights of brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces, should there be any, under Article 1001.
""xxx                xxx                 xxx
""ART. 1001. Should brothers and sisters or their children survive with the widow or widower, the latter shall be entitled to one-half of the inheritance and the brothers and sisters or their children to the other half.""
[4]
Socorro and herein private respondents, along with the co-heirs of David Rosales, thereupon became
co-owners
of the property that originally descended from Macaria.
When their interest in the property was sold by the Burdeos heirs to petitioner, a right of redemption arose in favor of private respondents; thus:
""ART. 1619. Legal redemption is the right to be subrogated, upon the same terms and conditions stipulated in the contract, in the place of one who acquires a thing by purchase or dation in payment, or by any other transaction whereby ownership is transmitted by onerous title.""
""ART. 1620. A co-owner of a thing may exercise the right of redemption in case the shares of all the other co-owners or of any of them, are sold to a third person. If the price of the alienation is grossly excessive, the redemptioner shall pay only a reasonable one.""
We hold that the right of redemption was timely exercised by private respondents. Concededly, no written notice of the sale was given by the Burdeos heirs (vendors) to the co-owners[5] required under Article 1623 of the Civil Code ""
""ART. 1623. The right of legal pre-emption or redemption shall not be exercised except within thirty days from the notice in writing by the prospective vendor, or by the vendor, as the case may be. The deed of sale shall not be recorded in the Registry of Property, unless accompanied by an affidavit of the vendor that he has given written notice thereof to all possible redemptioners.""
Hence, the thirty-day period of redemption had yet to commence when private respondent Rosales sought to exercise the right of redemption on 31 March 1987, a day after she discovered the sale from the Office of the City Treasurer of Butuan City, or when the case was initiated, on 16 October 1987, before the trial court.
The written notice of sale is mandatory. This Court has long established the rule that notwithstanding actual knowledge of a co-owner, the latter is still entitled to a written notice from the selling co-owner in order to remove all uncertainties about the sale, its terms and conditions, as well as its efficacy and status.
[6]
Even in
Alonzo vs. Intermediate Appellate Court,
[7]
relied upon by petitioner in contending that actual knowledge should be an equivalent to a written notice of sale, the Court made it clear that it was not reversing the prevailing jurisprudence; said the Court:
""We realize that in arriving at our conclusion today, we are deviating from the strict letter of the law, which the respondent court understandably applied pursuant to existing jurisprudence. The said court acted properly as it had no competence to reverse the doctrines laid down by this Court in the above-cited cases. In fact, and this should be clearly stressed, we ourselves are not abandoning the De Conejero and Buttle doctrines. What we are doing simply is adopting an exception to the general rule, in view of the peculiar circumstances of this case.""
[8]
In
Alonzo,
the right of legal redemption was invoked several years, notjust days or months, after the consummation of the contracts of sale. The complaint for legal redemption itself was there filed more than thirteen years after the sales were concluded.
Relative to the question posed by petitioner on private respondentsâ tender of payment, it is enough that we quote, with approval, the appellate court;
viz
:
""In contrast, records clearly show that an amount was offered, as required in Sempio vs. Del Rosario, 44 Phil. 1 and Daza vs. Tomacruz, 58 Phil. 414, by the redemptioner-appellant during the barangay conciliation proceedings (Answer, par. 8) but was flatly rejected by the appellee, not on the ground that it was not the purchase price (though it appeared on the face of the deed of sale, Exh. âJ-1â), nor that it was offered as partial payment thereof, but rather that it was âunconscionableâ based upon its âpresent value.â (Answer, par. 8).""
[9]
All given, we find no error in the appellate courtâs finding that private respondents are entitled to the redemption of the subject property.
WHEREFORE,
the petition is
DENIED
and the assailed decision of the Court of Appeals is
AFFIRMED.
Costs against petitioner.

FIRST DIVISION
[ G.R. No. 94210, April 26, 1996 ]
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. PABLO MACAPAS, TRANQUILINO O. CALO, JR. AND BELARMINO ALLOCOD, ACCUSED.
D E C I S I O N
VITUG, J.:
Right after giving his testimony as the complainant-victim in a frustrated murder case,
[1]
Mariano Corvera, Sr., a former mayor of Nasipit in Agusan del Norte, was gunned down in cold blood by Pablo Macapas, the accused, inside the courtroom of the Regional Trial Court, Branch II, in Butuan City, then being presided over by Judge Rosarito F. Dabalos.
In due time,
[2]
a new charge for murder was filed against Macapas, along with his counsel, then Mayor Tranquilino O. Calo, Jr., and the latterâs driver, Belarmino Allocod, in an information (docketed Criminal Case No. 3464) that read:
""That on or about morning of March 10, 1988 at Capitol Building, Butuan City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation, conspiring, confederating together, and mutually helping one another, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shot one Mariano Corvera, Sr., with the use of a handgun, hitting the latter on the different parts of the body resulting to his death.
""That the commission of the crime is attended with the following aggravating circumstances, viz.:
""1. That it was committed in contempt of or with insult to public authorities; and
""2. That it was committed in a place where public authorities are engaged in the discharge of their duties.
""CONTRARY TO LAW: (Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code)""
[3]
On 08 December 1988, Executive Judge Dabalos ordered the raffle of the case and the issuance of a warrant of arrest, without bail, against Macapas. At the same time, a bail of P50,000.00
[4]
was fixed for each of Calo and Allocod.
Corveraâs son, Mariano Corvera, Jr., assailed before the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. SP No. 16383) the legality of the grant of bail to Calo and Allocod. On 31 January 1989, the Court of Appeals
[5]
set aside the questioned order and directed the court
a quo
to resolve the matter only after conducting the requisite hearing to determine whether or not the evidence of guilt was strong.
[6]
On 08 February 1989, Executive Judge Dabalos indorsed the case to Judge Jose Adao of Branch 1 of the same court,
[7]
stating that he had therefore requested authority from this Court for his inhibition on account of a previous lawyer-client relationship with one of the accused. The following day, Judge Adao, noting that accused Calo and Allocod had voluntarily surrendered themselves, placed the accused in the custody of the Provincial Commander of the Philippine Constabulary at the detention center in Camp Rafael Rodriguez, Libertad, Butuan City.
[8]
On 24 February 1989, Judge Adao, after hearing, fixed bail in the amounts of P100,000.00 and P60,000.00 for the provisional liberty, respectively, of Calo and Allocod.
[9]
This Court, however, upon petition of the prosecution in
G.R. No. 87194,
issued, on 15 March 1989, an order temporarily restraining the lower court from enforcing its order of 24 February 1989 while the case was pending disposition by the Court of Appeals to which the matter was referred.
[10]
Judge Adao thus directed the recommitment of Calo and Allocod at Camp Rodriquez.
[11]
On 16 May 1989, the Court of Appeals
[12]
ultimately dismissed the petition (CA-G.R. SP No. 17142) on the basis of its finding that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in granting bail to Calo and Allocod.
[13]
The prosecution and private complainant Mariano Corvera, Jr., thereupon elevated the case to this Court via a petition for
certiorari
(
G.R. No. 88531
). On 06 July 1989, the Court ordered the cancellation of the bail in favor of Calo and Allocod and temporarily restrained the Court of Appeals from enforcing its resolution of 16 May 1989.
[14]
On 18 June 1990, through a resolution penned by Justice Abdulwahid A. Bidin, the Court granted the petition, set aside the 16th May 1989 decision of the Court of Appeals and made permanent the temporary restraining order it had previously issued.
[15]
In the meanwhile, acting on the request of Executive Judge Dabalos in Administrative Matter No. 88-12-3478-RTC for the assignment of Criminal Case No. 3464 to another court, this Court, on 02 February 1989, issued a resolution requiring Judge Zenaida P. Placer to take over the case, The prosecution and complainant Mariano Corvera, Jr., however, later moved for her inhibition on the ground that Calo was the lawyer of Judge Placerâs family. Judge Placer denied the motion on the strength of her having been designated by this Court.
Once again, the prosecution and Mariano Corvera, Jr., sought this Courtâs intervention through a petition for
certiorari
and prohibition (
G.R. No. 87932
). The Solicitor General prayed for the dismissal of the petition, stating that his Office had not authorized anyone to institute it. On 20 July 1989, the Court held that Mariano Corvera, Jr., being the offended party, had sufficient personality and interest to file the special civil action. On the merits of the case, the Court ruled that, considering her past professional relationship with one of the accused and the fact that the case was rather controversial in nature, Judge Placer should be disqualified from hearing it. In her stead, the Court designated Judge Alfredo Lagamon of the Regional Trial Court of Cagayan de Oro City to try the case.
[16]
Finally, on 31 March 1989, Calo and Allocod were arraigned; both pleaded not guilty to the charge.
[17]
The prosecution gave the following narration of its case.
Mariano Corvera, Sr., the town Mayor of Nasipit, Agusan del Norte, used to be the vice-president and manager of the Nasipit Integrated Arrastre Stevedoring Services, Inc., (""NIASSI""). He was replaced on 13 June 1986 by Benjamin Jaramillo, who, like Corvera, was a stockholder of the corporation.
Corvera questioned the election of the corporate officers before the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") which thereupon issued a restraining order. Atty. Tranquilino Calo, Jr., another stockholder, received the order. Calo told Jaramillo that there was no need to be concerned about Corveraâs complaint with the SEC. Later, during the conversation, Calo was heard to have remarked,
""Ah,
mas
maayo
pa
tingale
atong
liquidahon
si
Anoy
[Mariano Corvera]
kay
samokan
(Ah, it is better to liquidate Anoy because he is troublesome).""
[18]
On 20 November 1986, which was Jaramilloâs birthday and the 11th anniversary of the founding of NIASSI, the late Mayor Pedrito Carmona of Nasipit and Calo met at Jaramilloâs office. Once again, Calo threatened to liquidate Corvera.
[19]
On 06 March 1988, Jaramillo received an injunction order, dated 29 February 1988, from the SEC. The following day, 07 March 1988, Jaramillo went to NIASSI to re-assume his position. In the afternoon, Corvera, together with Engr. Berido, Tiburcio Guno and Col. Esparagoza (retired), went to Jaramilloâ s office to congratulate him. All were taken aback when Calo, with his bodyguards, among them Macapas and Ignacio Albarrigo, banged the door, barged in and shouted at everyone else to get out of the room. Calo pointed his finger at Corvera and shouted, ""I will see you dead!""
[20]
In the morning of 10 March 1988, during the scheduled trial in Criminal Case No. 2850, Executive Judge Dabalos, Atty. Rosales, Corvera, Calo, court personnel Arturo Cinco and Calixtro Berol, Fiscal Ambrosio Gallarde, and four or five spectators, including Dr. Nelson ObeÃ±ita, were in attendance. Stating that Corvera was booked for the ten oâclock, a.m., flight for Cebu, Atty. Rosales moved for the re-setting of the hearing. Calo, counsel for accused Macapas, opposed the motion saying that he himself was scheduled to take the same flight that morning.
[21]
At about 9:30 a.m., Corvera took the witness stand. Atty. Rosales noticed that while Calo was conducting the cross-examination, he appeared agitated and tense, so much unlike his usual calm way in court.
[22]
At about ten oâclock, the parties finally agreed to the resetting of the hearing to 22 April 1988. As soon as the judge banged his gavel to adjourn the proceedings, Calo stood up and walked towards the eastern door. Macapas left ahead of Calo but Calo overtook Macapas. Atty. Rosales himself was about to leave when he saw Macapas return to the courtroom holding a revolver and walking in calmly. Then, all of a sudden, he pointed the gun at Corvera. Visibly shaken, Corvera tried to open the western door of the room but it would not budge. Unable to exit, Corvera raised his hands, saying ""
Ayaw,
ayaw,
ayaw""
[23]
(Donât, donât, donât). Corvera tripped while retreating. He hastily stood up and grabbed a chair to shield himself, still pleading ""
Ayaw,
ayaw.""
[24]
Unmoved, Macapas took aim and pressed the trigger. Corvera fell, his hands and feet shaking. Macapas drew closer to Corvera and fired again at his victim. Macapas then turned away as calmly as when he entered the room.
Atty. Rosales tried to lift Corvera but found him too heavy. Soon four or five other persons came in to help, and they brought Corvera down the building and from there to the hospital. Fiscal Gallarde surfaced from under the lawyersâ table, pale and scared.
[25]
Fernando Casinao was with the group of Corvera that morning. With them were Raul Abao, Pacifico Larbonita and driver Oligario Barcelona. Corvera, Abao and Larbonita entered the courtroom while Casinao remained at the lobby near the eastern door.
[26]
Shortly before ten oâclock, Casinao saw security men of Calo in the vicinity of the western door.
[27]
He later saw Calo leave the courtroom through the eastern door. A woman who had ascended the eastern stairs conversed with Calo for a few seconds. After the woman had left, Macapas walked towards Calo. Calo handed over a revolver to Macapas. After receiving the firearm, Macapas went back to the courtroom. At that moment, Caloâs security guards were near the stairs while Larbonita was about a foot away to the left of Casinao.
[28]
Casinao tried to follow Macapas but a person who was standing by the door pushed Casinao back sending him to the railing. Abruptly, there was a burst of gunfire, followed by two more gunshots. Casinao dashed in to the courtroom and, on the way, bumped on Macapas at the eastern door. Casinao saw Corvera lying flat on his back near the western door with his feet towards the podium. Seeing that Corvera was still alive and Atty. Rosales unsuccessfully trying to lift him up, Casinao rushed downstairs and summoned for help to get Corvera fast to the Santos Hospital.
[29]
Pacifico Larbonita, a 63-year-old
""alalay""
of Corvera, left the courtroom at around ten oâclock that morning. He went near the eastern door, squatted a meter away from the door, and smoked. When Calo left the courtroom, Larbonita stood up. Calo remained around two feet away from the eastern door. A lady approached Calo and conversed with him for around five seconds. Just as the lady was departing, Macapas came out of the courtroom and Calo handed a gun over to him. Larbonita was unable to see where Calo got the gun.
[30]
Macapas went back to the courtroom. Moments later, Larbonita heard a gunshot; then two more gunshots rang out.
[31]
Dr. Nelson ObeÃ±ita, a physician of the Nasipit Lumber Company, was in the courtroom to attend the hearing.
[32]
After the court had adjourned, Dr. ObeÃ±ita promptly signed the certificate of attendance and exited through the gallery entrance. Outside the courtroom, he saw Casinao. Dr. ObeÃ±ita went down the capitol building through the main entrance. He was in the garden barely twenty meters away when he heard gunshots. He turned to look back; moments later, he saw a man rushing down the stairs of the capitol building. The man proceeded to a vehicle parked by the side of the provincial treasurerâs office. Dr. ObeÃ±ita recognized the man to be Macapas. Macapas boarded the vehicle, taking the seat to the right of the driver.
[33]
Maj. Rolando T. Brillantes, then assistant provincial commander for operations of the PC-INP in Agusan del Norte, was in the office of the provincial governor at between 9:00 and 9:30, a.m., of 10 March 1989, to discuss with the governor the laborersâ strike in Nasipit. A commotion outside the building was heard. Then, someone shouted that Mayor Corvera had been shot. Maj. Brillantes went out to the balcony where he saw ""the car of Mayor Calo (was) speeding away.""
[34]
Maj. Evacueto de los Santos, the deputy station commander and operations officer of the Butuan Police Station, learned of the shooting incident from the radio operator. Immediately, he boarded the police car and proceeded to the capitol building with some of his men. There, he was met by PC Major Rolando Brillantes and PC Captain Godofredo de los Santos. While Major de los Santos was being briefed by the two PC officers, the ""armored car"" of Calo returned to the capitol grounds. Maj. De los Santos directed his men to apprehend the driver and to bring him to the police station. At the police station, the driver, Allocod, denied involvement in the incident.
[35]
Sixty seven-year old Corvera sustained three gunshot wounds - one on the right arm which hit and fractured the scapula with the bullet lodged at the trapereus muscle of the back; another on the chest which pierced the skin, costal muscle, blood vessels and right lobe of the lung with the bullet lodged at the sorratus anterior muscle, and the third on the abdomen below the umbilicus piercing the abdominal muscle, the small intestines and the abdominal aorta, subclavia vein, with the bullet lodged at the tissue above the latissimus dorsi muscle.
[36]
Dr. Elsie Caballero concluded that Corvera died of ""shock, internal hemorrhage, (and) multiple gunshot wound(s).""
[37]
Police authorities were never able to apprehend Macapas.
In his defense, Calo pictured himself to be incapable of the dastardly act.
[38]
Although he was removed as a municipal judge for grave misconduct and gross ignorance of the law,
[39]
he, nevertheless, remained to be a respected practicing lawyer.
[40]
He was an undefeated candidate for mayoralty in Carmen, Agusan del Norte, and for a time headed the ""mayorsâ league"" of the province. He denied having given a gun to Macapas
[41]
or as having had him as a bodyguard.
[42]
On 16 March 1990, the trial court promulgated the herein questioned decision disposing of the case, viz:
""WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused TRANQUILINO O. CALO, JR. and BELARMINO ALLOCOD guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code qualified by treachery and with the generic aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation, and hereby sentences both accused to suffer the penalty of
Reclusion
Perpetua.
""On the civil liability, the two accused are hereby jointly and severally sentenced to pay to the heirs of the late Mariano Corvera, Sr. the following:
""a) P30,000.00 as death compensation;
""b) P20,000.00 as reimbursement of burial expenses;
""c) P100,000.00 as reimbursement of litigation expenses and attorneyâs fee;
""d) P800,000.00 representing unrealized net income for eight (8) years;
""e) P500,000.00 by way of moral damages; and
""f) P 100,000.00 as exemplary damages.
""SO ORDERED.""
[43]
When their motion for the reconsideration
[44]
of the decision was denied,
[45]
Calo and Allocod, through counsel, filed a notice of appeal to this Court.
[46]
During the pendency of his appeal, Calo died of myocardial infraction secondary to coronary insufficiency at the New Bilid Prisons Hospital in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila, per the certificate of postmortem examination issued by the National Bureau of Investigation.
[47]
Pursuant to the ruling in
People vs. Bayotas,
[48]
the instant appeal should thus be confined only to Allocodâs case.
Appellant Allocod evidently was linked to the commission of the crime for being then the driver of Calo. The only evidence that could provide some indication on his possible involvement in the story of the prosecution would be a portion of the testimony of Dr. ObeÃ±ita, as well as that of Maj. Brillantes, in connection with the declaration of Dr. ObeÃ±ita. Dr. ObeÃ±ita testified:
""Q.
What did you do?
""A.
When I heard two shots, I turned my back and tried to observe what would happen next. Later on I saw a man coming down from the stairs of the capitol, he reached the capitol grounds, he made a few glances, left and right and proceeded to the parked vehicle on that side of the capitol, that side of the provincial treasurerâs office.
""Q.
You said you saw that person, who was that person?
""A.
Macapas.
""Q.
You said he went to that vehicle which was parked on that right side, what happened after he went to that vehicle?
""A.
He went to the vehicle and boarded the vehicle on the right side of the driver. He took a seat and made a motion to hide in the vehicle and they left.
""Q.
Who is the owner of that vehicle which was parked and which was boarded by Pablo Macapas?
""A.
I presume it was owned by Atty. Calo since I often saw that vehicle being used by Atty. Calo.""
[49]
For his part, Maj. Brillantes stated:
""Q.
When you went out to the balcony of the Provincial Governorâs Office, what did you see?
""A.
When I went out I saw the car of Mayor Calo speeding away.
""Q.
To what direction?
""A.
Towards the highway. From the Capitol towards the direction of the DBP.
""Q.
And what did you do after you saw the vehicle of Atty. Calo speeding towards the DBP?
""A.
I called the attention of the Central Police Station.
""Q.
What made you call the attention of the Central Police Station?
""A.
I called the Central Police Station from my hand set radio, because I saw that the car was running very fast. It was very unusual and very suspicious. So, what was on my mind was that it might be that the car was used by the assailant.
""Q.
Were you able to contact the Central Police Station?
""A.
Yes, sir, I was able to contact Major Evacueto delos Santos and I told him to please intercept the car of Mayor Calo which left the Capitol Building just a few minutes, and Major delos Santos reacted to my request.
""Q.
What happened after that?
""A.
He was able to apprehend the driver. Right then and there, he brought the driver to the police station.
""Q.
What was the name of the driver?
""A.
I do not know the name of the driver.""
[50]
What might have been expected to be the clincher had come from Maj. De los Santos who testified:
""Q.
Then, what did you do after being informed that ex-mayor Corvera was shot?
""A.
While I was informed, the armored car of Mayor Tranquilino Calo came back to the Capitol ground.
""Q.
When that armored car of Atty. Tranquilino Calo came back to the Capitol ground, what happened?
""A.
I was directed by Major Brillantes to apprehend the driver of the car because they saw that that was the gate away vehicle used by the assailant.
""Q.
In effect did you carry out the order of this officer?
""A.
Yes, Sir.
""Q.
What did you do next?
""A.
I ordered my men to bring the car and the driver of Mayor Calo to the police station for proper investigation.
xxx xxx xxx.
""Q.
When you went back to the police station, what did you do there, if any?
""A.
I looked for Allocod, the driver of the armored car of Mayor Calo.
""Q.
In effect did you meet Allocod there?
""A.
Yes, Sir, and I even asked him some questions but he denied everything.""
[51]
Regrettably, not one of the witnesses was able to definitively identify the driver of the get-away car. In fact, according to Maj. De los Santos, appellant Allocod was apprehended only because he ""came back"" to the capitol grounds.
The review of this case yielded the distressing fact that both the prosecution and defense vigorously focused the evidence and argument on the culpability of Calo. As a result, as regards appellant Allocod, the indispensable requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt to convict an accused had all but been missed in the process.
WHEREFORE,
the case against Tranquilino T. Calo, Jr., now deceased, is hereby dismissed. Appellant Belarmino Allocod is acquitted for the failure of the prosecution to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Costs
de oficio.
SO ORDERED.

Criminal Case No. 2850, Exh. V. Briefly, the prosecution charged that at around 6:30 in the evening of 01 April 1985, Corvera was driving a jeep with Estelito Tecson, Jr., his passenger, on the way home to Nasipit from Kinabhangan. Along the highway, three persons, one of whom was Pablo Macapas, hailed the vehicle and asked for a ride. Just as Corvera was slowing down, Macapas pointed a gun at Tecson who, upon seeing what was about to happen, parried the hand of Macapas. The gun exploded and a bullet hit the right parietal region of Corveraâs head. Corvera recovered from the wound.

Criminal Case No. 3464 was filed only on 29 November 1988. The original information, which was filed on 29 August 1988, had to be withdrawn after City Fiscal Macario Balansag, who filed it, was gunned down on his way to his office. As a result of his death, the National Bureau of Investigation filed murder charges against Calo, his son Jesus, and three other persons (Records, Vol. I, p. 164).

ESTABLISHMENT, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N
PADILLA, J.:
Petitioners seek to annul the resolutions of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) dated 29 November 1993 and 15 April 1994 dismissing their complaints for lack of merit.
Petitioners applied for overseas employment thru private respondent A.P. Placement Specialist Center. After going through different types of examination, petitioners were hired by respondent SAAD Construction Establishment, as either technician, air duct fabricator, plumber or pipe insulator at the King Khalid Military Camp, Batin, Saudi Arabia. Petitioners were deployed on different dates from October 10 to December 1989, but each worked for less than three (3) months, because on 11 February 1990, they were sent home allegedly without a justifiable cause. Before they were repatriated, the sums of US$435 or US$635 were also deducted from their wages.
By private respondentsâ account, the employment contracts signed by petitioners provided for a probationary period of three (3) months within which the employer could terminate the contract in accordance with law.
[1]
During petitionersâ employment with respondent company (SAAD Construction), they were warned in writing that their refusal to carry out the orders and instructions of their supervisors without a valid cause and their instigation of co-workers to stop working or not to report for work were acts prejudicial to the company and hence, similar acts in the future would be dealt with severely. Petitionersâ performance on the jobs did not improve, so on different dates from 5 February to 10 February 1990, their employments were terminated for non-compliance with requirements for qualification and for violation of company rules and regulations. The sums of US$435 or US$635 were deducted from their wages to cover repatriation expenses.
Petitioners individually filed complaints for illegal dismissal against their foreign employer, SAAD Construction Establishment, represented by A.P. Placement in cases before the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA). The POEA consolidated and jointly heard the cases and rendered a decision on 11 December 1991, the dispositive part of which states:
""WHEREFORE, the respondents A.P. Placement Specialist Center, Saad Construction Est., and Times Surety Insurance Co., Inc. are hereby ordered to pay the following complainants:
1.ALDIN H. GARAIS   - SR28,845.00 and US$435.00
2.NILO DEL SOL      - SR28,845.00 and US$435.00
3.NESTOR A. MENDOZA - SR28,845.00 and US$435.00
4.CELESTINO E. BALMES- SR28,845.00 and US$435.00
5.DOMINGO O. MENDOZA- SR28,845.00 and US$435.00
6.EDUARDO A. RAYOS  - SR29,970.00 and US$635.00
7.ARNEL C. CASTANEDA- SR29,000.00 and US$635.00
8.ERNESTO M. PERCULEZA- SR24,200.00 and US$635.00
9.EDGARDO PENALOSA  - SR29,000.00 and US$635.00
10.OSCAR T. SANTOS  - SR28,845.00 and US$635.00
or their peso equivalent at time of payment.""
[2]
Private respondents appealed the POEA decision to the NLRC. While the memorandum of appeal filed by private respondents was dated 3 January 1992, the surety bond was posted only on 25 March 1992 after respondent NLRC issued a resolution dated 20 March 1992 directing private respondents to post a cash or surety bond based on the latterâs own computation. Upon receipt of the 20 March 1992 resolution of the NLRC and the private respondentsâ notice of compliance therewith, petitioners filed an omnibus opposition on the ground, among others, that the POEA decision had already become final and executory after private respondents failed to perfect the appeal within the ten-day reglementary period provided under the POEA Rules and Regulations.
[3]
Petitioners alleged therein that in order to perfect an appeal to the NLRC, private respondents should have posted a cash or surety bond in an amount equivalent to the monetary award of the POEA within ten (10) days from receipt of the POEA decision. The bond in this case was posted beyond the reglementary period provided by the POEA Rules and Regulations.
On 29 November 1993, public respondent NLRC, unperturbed by the serious objection of petitioners based on jurisdictional grounds, reversed the POEA decision and dismissed the complaints of petitioners for lack of merit. The motion for reconsideration was likewise denied on 15 April 1994. Hence, this petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed on 14 July 1994.
Petitioners assail the resolutions of public respondent NLRC on the following grounds:
I
THE HONORABLE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (NLRC) COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN SIDE-STEPPING THE ISSUE ON FINALITY RAISED BY THE PLEADINGS AND/OR IN NOT HOLDING THE DECISION OF 11 DECEMBER 1991 OF THE POEA ALREADY FINAL AND EXECUTORY; AND
II
THE HONORABLE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (NLRC) COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION TANTAMOUNT TO LACK OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT SET ASIDE AND REVERSED THE DECISION OF 11 DECEMBER 1991 OF THE POEA DESPITE THE FACT THE SAME WAS SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE AND THE LAW APPLICABLE.
[4]
We will first discuss the procedural aspect of the imputed errors. Petitioners claim that respondent NLRC did not have any jurisdiction to entertain the appeal of private respondents because it was filed beyond the ten-day (10) reglementary period for appeal to the NLRC. Surprisingly, private respondents are silent on this issue. They did not refute petitionersâ argument on the final and executory character of the POEA decision, but they insist that respondent NLRC did not gravely abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaints of petitioners. On the other hand, respondent NLRC thru the Office of the Solicitor General alleges that there is no clear and satisfactory evidence that private respondents failed to perfect the appeal to the NLRC. The Office of the Solicitor General concludes that when the NLRC acted on private respondentsâ motion to reduce the bond dated 20 January 1992, it decreed that it had jurisdiction over the case.
The petitionersâ argument is well-founded. The POEA decision dated 11 December 1991 had indeed become final and executory. Section 5, Rule V of the POEA Rules and Regulations enumerates the requisites for perfection of an appeal to the NLRC, thus:
""Section 5.
Requisites for Perfection of Appeal.
The appeal shall be filed within the reglementary period as provided in Section 1 of this Rule; shall be under oath with proof of payment of the required appeal fee and the posting of a cash or surety bond as provided in Section 6 of this Rule; shall be accompanied by a memorandum of appeal which shall state the grounds relied upon and the arguments in support thereof; the relief prayed for; and a statement of the date when the appellant received the appealed decision and/or award and proof of service on the other party of such appeal.
A mere notice of appeal without complying with the other requisites afore stated shall not stop the running of the period for perfecting an appeal.""
The requirements above mentioned shall be filed by the appellant within ten (10) days from receipt of the POEA decision, otherwise, the decision becomes final and executory. Non-compliance with such requisites will not stop the running of the prescriptive period.
[5]
The Rules likewise stress the importance of posting a bond in the perfection of appeal to the NLRC. Section 6, Rule V thereof states:""
""Section 6. BOND. In case the decision of the Administration involves a monetary award, an appeal by the employer
shall be perfected only upon the posting of a cash or surety bond
issued by a reputable bonding company duly accredited by the Commission in an amount equivalent to the monetary award."" (italics supplied)
Section 6, in relation to Section 5, Rule V, earlier quoted, attests to the intention of the lawmaker to make the bond an indispensable requirement for the perfection of an appeal to the NLRC by the employer. The Court made this pronouncement in the case of
Viron Garments v. NLRC
[6]
which involved the issue of whether or not the posting of a cash or surety bond is a mandatory requirement for the perfection of an appeal to the NLRC. Although the appeal in that case was from the decision of the labor arbiter and not of the POEA, the POEA Rules and Regulations and the Labor Code provide for similar provisions governing appeals to the NLRC. The presence of this provision in legislation and in the POEA rules is evidence of the stateâs adherence to the policy of full protection to labor. The posting of a cash or surety bond is intended to assure the workers that if they finally prevail in the case, the monetary award will be given to them upon the dismissal of the employerâs appeal. It is further intended to discourage employers from using the appeal to delay or evade payment of their obligations to the employees.
[7]
In the case at bar, the records do not show clearly when the private respondents received the POEA decision. Neither was the date of appeal to the NLRC indicated in the pleadings submitted before this Court. However, it can be gathered from the records that private respondents received copy of the POEA decision before 3 January 1992 because the memorandum of appeal to the NLRC was dated 3 January 1992. If we were to give a wide latitude to respondent A.P. Placement by supposing that it received the POEA decision only on 3 January 1992, private respondents would have ten (10) days from 3 January 1992 or until 13 January 1992 to post the required bond in order to perfect the appeal to the NLRC. Even again assuming that the memorandum of appeal was filed on the same day the POEA decision was received, still the motion to fix the bond was filed more than ten (10) days therefrom, or on 20 January 1992 and the bond was posted only on 25 March 1992.
Therefore, since the appeal from the POEA was not perfected within the reglementary period, the NLRC did not acquire jurisdiction over the case, as perfection of the appeal to the NLRC is not only mandatory but also jurisdictional.
[8]
Hence, the petitionersâ first argument is well-taken.
Consequently, the Court sees no need for a discussion of the second issue. Besides, said second issue requires a determination of facts that can no longer be raised by the parties on certiorari.
WHEREFORE,
the Court finds the respondent NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in taking cognizance of the appeal of private respondents. The NLRC resolutions dated 29 November 1993 and 15 April 1994 are hereby
SET ASIDE,
and the POEA decision dated 11 December 1991 is DECLARED to have become final and executory. Cost against private respondents.

PADILLA, J.:
Petitioners appeal from the decision
[1]
of the Sandiganbayan, First Division, promulgated on 15 April 1994, finding them guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, qualified by superior strength, and sentencing them to suffer the penalty of
reclusion perpetua
and to indemnify the heirs of the victim, Bernardito P. Vencer, in the amount of P50,000.00 as indemnify for death, as well as other damages and costs of suit.
The Information filed by the Special Prosecutor/Ombudsman before the public respondent reads as follows:
""That on or about April 25, 1986 at Brgy. Calangag, Batad, Iloilo, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused GEORGE ARCENO, SAMSON ARCENO, ROBERTO P. JINO-O, all members of the Integrated National Police assigned at the INP sub-station, Batad, Iloilo, MARCELINO S. PALMA, JR., NOEL A. BANICO, Staff Sergeant and a Constable 2nd Class (C2C), respectively of the 321st Philippine Constabulary Company, Camp Jalandoni, Sara, Iloilo, while allegedly on a military operation to effect the arrest of one Bernardito Vencer, mutually conspiring and confederating with one another and with ZALDY C. ARCENO, also of 321st Philippine Constabulary Company, and with civilians Alejandro Gullos, Pablo Bernales and Igmedio Ecoy, Jr., taking advantage of their superior strength and number and with the aid of armed men, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot, stab and kill one Bernardito P. Vencer, which offense was committed by the accused in relation to their office.
CONTRARY TO LAW.""
[2]
The accused were arraigned on 28 October 1991 and with the assistance of their counsel
de parte,
each entered a plea of not guilty.
The prosecutionâs version of the facts are as follows:
On 25 April 1986, the victim Bernardito P. Vencer, upon instruction of his father, went to the house of his uncle, Bernardino Vencer, in Barangay Calangag, Batad, Iloilo City, to get some rice. At around 11:00 or 11:30 in the evening of the same date, Bernardino Vencer was awakened by one Alejandro Gullos who told him that there were policemen with him (Gullos) downstairs looking for his nephew Bernardito Vencer. When Bernardino opened the windows, he saw a group composed of policemen, PC soldiers and some civilians. He was able to recognize the military men to be Zaldy ArceÃ±o, Noel Banico, Marcelino Palma, Samson ArceÃ±o, Domingo Diosalan, Raymundo Escovidal, Roberto Jino-o, Rolly Gellera, Faustino ArceÃ±o, Jr., George ArceÃ±o and the civilians as Alejandro Gullos, Pablo Bernales and Igmedio Ecoy, Jr. He was able to recognize them all because aside from being his townmates, the moon was shining brightly that night. He went downstairs where the group told him that they were taking with them his nephew Bernardito Vencer for investigation at the Headquarters but they did not show him any warrant of arrest. Despite his plea that the investigation be done in the morning, the group managed to take Bernardito with them.
Witness Fernando Aguasa, an
""herbolario""
who treated the sick child of Bernardino in the afternoon of the same day, decided to stay overnight and sleep at the house of Bernardino because it was drizzling that night. At about midnight, Aguasa and Bernardino were awakened by Alejandro Gullos. He heard Gullos asking Bernardino if his nephew Bernardito was in their house to which Bernardino answered in the affirmative. When Aguasa peeped out of the window, he saw Alejandro Gullos, Zaldy ArceÃ±o, Samson ArceÃ±o, Domingo Diosalan, Raymundo Escovidal, Noel Banico and Pablo Bernales. He was able to recognize them because it was no longer raining and the moon was shining brightly. He saw the group, with Bernardito Vencer with them, proceeding to the direction of the east. Both Bernardino Vencer and Fernando Aguasa declared that about twenty (20) to thirty (30) minutes after the group had left, they heard a shot which was followed by successive shots coming from the east.
At about 3:00 oâclock in the early morning of 26 April 1986, Edmundo Evangelio passed by Bernardinoâs house and told them of the death of Bernardito.
Edmundo Evangelio, a farmer of Barangay Calangag, Batad, Iloilo, testified that at about 7:00 p.m. on 25 April 1996, he went to his hut to watch his newly harvested palay. The weather was then fine and the moon brightly shining. The hut was two (2) meters higher in elevation compared to the ricefield. It measured about two (2) arms long in width and more than two (2) arms long in length. It had no walls; the floor was made of bamboo slats which were about a knee high from the ground. Its roof was A-shaped, made of cogon. The crest was not covered so that the moonlight illuminated the inner portion of the hut.
At about midnight, he heard voices of people who were coming from the east and walking towards his hut. He immediately went down from the hut and hid himself behind the
""talahib""
grass about 6-1/2 meters away. As the group approached the hut, he recognized as among them Bernardito Vencer escorted by two (2) policemen, George ArceÃ±o and Samson ArceÃ±o, P.C. Zaldy ArceÃ±o and three (3) civilians Alejandro Gullos, Pablo Bernales and Igmedio Ecoy, Jr. The ArceÃ±o brothers (George, Samson and Zaldy) were not in uniform but he saw them carrying long firearms. He knew personally the victim Bernardito because he was once his classmate in the elementary grades. The two (2) ArseÃ±o brothers (George and Samson) were policemen assigned in their town. Igmedio Ecoy was his schoolmate, and he often saw Pablo Bernales in the poblacion of Batad.
From his hiding place, Evangelio saw how the victim was slain. According to Evangelio, Bernardito was made to sit on the floor of the hut facing George ArceÃ±o who interrogated Bernardito about his identity, the latter answering that he was Bernardito, and why he was at Brgy. Calangag. He heard Bernardito say he was there to get rice from his uncle. Evangelio presumed that George did not believe Bernardito because he saw George shoot Bernardito and push the latter who fell, face upwards. Then, he saw Bernardito stand up, plead for mercy to the group not to kill him as he had not done anything wrong. He heard George order Bernardito to run but the latter remained standing. He then saw George, Samson and Zaldy ArceÃ±o who were crowding Bernardito aim their firearms at Bernardito and he heard several shots. A moment later, he saw Bernardito struggle on his knees and embrace the legs of Samson ArceÃ±o, still pleading for mercy. The next moment, the witness heard another gunshot. He saw Bernardito still embracing the thigh of ArceÃ±o. Then they pushed Bernardito who fell on the ground, face downwards. Evangelio heard the group blaming Igmedio Ecoy Jr. for firing a shot while Bernardito was embracing the legs of Samson, thus hitting the latter. He saw Igmedio Ecoy Jr. standing about one meter away from Bernardito.
Afterwards, the witness (Evangelio) saw and heard George ArceÃ±o order Pablo Bernales to stab Bernardito. He saw Bernales, who was standing somewhere near the head of Bernardito, stab Bernardito who was lying prostrate with his hands extended forward. Since he was already scared, Evangelio did not notice which hand Bernales used in stabbing the victim nor the number of times that he stabbed Bernardito. Then the group left. He stayed at his hiding place for sometime as he was very scared. After about two (2) hours, he went home, passing the house of Bernardino Vencer and there he shouted to the latter that his nephew Bernardito was killed by some policemen.
The medical report dated 26 April 1986 of Dr. Noel C. Posadas, Rural Health Physician of Batad, Iloilo, who conducted an external examination of the cadaver of Bernardito Vencer at 5:16 p.m. on 26 April 1986, shows that Bernardito died of ""irreversible shock due to profuse hemorrhage due to massive lacerations of the lungs, big blood vessels of the neck due to multiple gunshot and stab wounds"" (Exhibit ""T"").
Upon request of the victimâs family, a re-autopsy of the cadaver was done by the National Bureau of Investigation. Dr. Ricardo Y. Jaboneta, of the Medico-Legal Office of the NBI, Region VI, Iloilo City, conducted on 30 April 1986 an autopsy of the body which was already embalmed. His findings were contained in Necropsy Report No. 86-N-04 (Exhibit ""A""). The autopsy revealed that the cause of death was ""hemorrhage, massive, secondary to multiple gunshot and stab wounds.""
On the other hand, the version of the defense runs thus:
Sometime in April 1986, PNP Chief Inspector Noel Rosales, who was then the Commanding Officer of 321st PC Company, INP District IV, in Camp Jalandoni, Sara, Iloilo, received reliable information from his NCO Intelligence Reporter that Bernardo Vencer, a notorious criminal, was present at Batad, Iloilo. He issued Mission Order No. 0405-86 dated 24 April 1986 (Exhibit ""3"") to S/Sgt. Marcelino Palma, Jr. as Team Leader, C2C Noel Banico, Pat. George ArceÃ±o and Pat. Roberto Jino-o, directing them to verify the veracity of the report, conduct preventive patrol and arrest Bernardo Vencer alias ""Bernardito"" or ""Odong"" at Batad, Iloilo, and turn him (Bernardito) over to the Station Commander of Batad.
The team left Headquarters for Brgy. Binon-an, Batad, Iloilo, the following day, 25 April 1986, at 1:00 p.m. They had with them two (2) warrants of arrest against Bernardo Vencer alias Bernardito issued by the Regional Trial Court of Iloilo and by the Municipal Trial Court of Batad. They proceeded to Batad Police Station at 8:00 p.m. to coordinate with the Station Commander and they asked for another police officer to augment their team. Officer-in-charge Franklin Catequista, upon request of S/Sgt. Palma, designated Samson ArceÃ±o to be the teamâs guard as the latter was more familiar with the place where their quarry was hiding. They rode on two (2) motorcycles which they borrowed from Binon-an Barangay Captain Ruben Bernales and Rolly Geller a PC member. They hid the motorcycles in a cogonal area at Brgy. Cabaguhan before proceeding to Brgy. Calangag.
The group just walked towards the nipa hut, the hideout of Bernardo Vencer, passing rice paddies, dikes and a creek. Upon reaching a hill about 100 meters away from the hut, Palma stopped the group and briefed his men on their respective positions in approaching the hut. Then the men positioned themselves as instructed in different directions approaching the hut. They reached the hut at about 10:30 p.m.
The hut was situated at the slope a rolling hill. While at the top of the hill, Samson ArceÃ±o noticed that there were lighted cigarettes inside the hut which led them to presume that there were persons inside. Upon nearing the place, they confirmed that there were about four (4) persons inside the hut.
They crawled towards the hut and when they reached the edge of the hut, Samson ArceÃ±o stood up. They were caught by surprise when a person, in a prone position inside the hut which was 1 1/2 meters away, fired at Samson. Seeing Samson fall down, Marcelino Palma shouted and identified themselves as PC and police officers. Thereafter, Palma shot Samsonâs assailant who, in turn, stood up and shot back at him. The other persons inside the hut fled firing their guns at the PC and police officers. For almost five (5) minutes, there was an exchange of gun fire between Palmaâs team and the group of Bernardito Vencer.
In the aftermath of the shooting, Samson found Bernardito Vencer dead. They recovered a pistolized shotgun and a double-bladed weapon from the victimâs body.
Marcelino Palma instructed George ArceÃ±o and Roberto Jino-o to watch over the cadaver and to wait for reinforcement and a medico-legal officer while he and Noel Banico brought Samson Arceno to the hospital for treatment. George testified that while he and Banico were watching over Bernarditoâs cadaver, the latterâs relatives came weeping and they took the body of Bernardito. He and Banico then left and proceeded to their headquarters at Sara, Iloilo.
In an attempt to exculpate himself, Zaldy Arceno put up alibi as defense. He alleged that per Guard Detail Order, he was assigned to be one of the guards on duty from 9:00 a.m. on 25 April 1986 to 9:00 a.m. of 26 April 1986, at their headquarters at 321st PC Co. at Sara, Iloilo; that there was specific instruction in the said Order for the guards on duty to stay in camp during their guard duty so that during the period material to the case, it was impossible for him to be present at the scene of the incident. Moreover, he asserted that the distance between Sara, Iloilo and Brgy. Calangag is 20 kilometers.
After trial, the Sandiganbayan rendered the now appealed judgment, the decretal part of which reads as follows:
""WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding Marcelino S. Palma, Jr., George C. Arceno, Samson C. Arceno, Zaldy C. Arceno, Noel A. Banico and Roberto P. Jino-o GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder defined and penalized under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, qualified by superior strength. Absent any modifying circumstance attending the commission of the crime, each of the accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of
reclusion perpetua,
with the accessory penalties provided for by law. They are ordered to pay, jointly and severally, the heirs of Bernardito P. Vencer in the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND (P50,000.00) PESOS as indemnity for death; TWENTY THOUSAND (20,000.00) PESOS as actual or compensatory damages, TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND (P218,000.00) PESOS by way of loss of earning capacity; and to pay the costs of this action proportionately.
Conformably to Supreme Court Circular No. 2-92, dated January 20, 1992, No. 3, 4th paragraph thereof which states that:
âWhen an accused is charged with a capital offense or an offense which under the law at the time of its commission and at the time of the application for bail is punishable by
reclusion perpetua
and is out on bail and after trial is convicted by the trial court of the offense charged, his bond shall be cancelled and the accused shall be placed in confinement pending resolution of his appeal.â
the property bonds of the accused are hereby cancelled and said accused are thereby ordered confined at the National Bureau of Prisons.
Thereafter, the Clerk of Court is directed to return all the documents relative to the property bonds posted by said accusedâs bondsmen, upon receipt therefor.
SO ORDERED.""
[3]
Petitioners moved for reconsideration but the motion was denied.
Hence, this petition for review, assigning the following errors to public respondent:
""I
THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN ERRED IN FINDING THAT IT HAS BEEN ADMITTED THAT THE PETITIONERS SHOT AND STABBED TO DEATH BERNARDITO VENCER;
II
THAT THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF FRANCISCO AGUASA AND EDMUNDO EVANGELIO;
III
THAT THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN ERRED IN NOT ACCEPTING THE JUSTIFYING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THE PETITIONERS, EXCEPT ZALDY ARCENO, RELIED UPON AS DEFENSE;
IV
THAT THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE PETITIONERS CONSPIRED TO KILL BERNARDITO VENCER;
V
THAT THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN ERRED IN FINDING THAT BERNARDITO VENCER WAS MISTAKEN FOR SEAMAN BERNARDO VENCER, THE REAL OBJECT OF ARREST IN THE FINDINGS OF THE HONORABLE COURT;
VI
THAT THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN ERRED IN NOT ACCEPTING THE DEFENSE OF ALIBI PUT UP BY PETITIONER ZALDY ARCENO; and
VII
THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN ERRED IN CONVICTING THE PETITIONERS.""
[4]
It is at once evident that the main thrust of petitionersâ assignment of error is to discredit the witnesses for the prosecution, particularly the testimonies of Fernando Aguasa and Edmundo Evangelio.
Petitioners contend that the testimonies of said witnesses for the prosecution are contradicting. They aver that while Aguasa testified that it was drizzling and cloudy that night of the incident, Evangelio, the eyewitness, in turn testified that the moon was brightly shining. Moreover, they assert that while Aguasa stated that the accused (petitioners) took Bernardito Vencer from the house of Bernardino Vencer before they proceeded to the hut, Evangelio testified that the accused (petitioners) came from the direction of the town.
We find such inconsistencies minor in character. Besides, it was established that while there was a drizzle in the evening of 25 April 1986, the moon had already come out before midnight of the same day.
We reiterate that minor inconsistencies or contradictions in the declarations of witnesses do not destroy their credibility but even enhance their truthfulness as they erase any suspicion of a rehearsed testimony.
[5]
The fact has been established that the victim was taken by the petitioners and brought to the hut/shed owned by Evangelio and thereat shot and stabbed. Moreover, the unbending jurisprudence is that the trial courtâs findings on the matter of credibility of witnesses are entitled to the highest degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of any showing that it had overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which would have affected the result of the case.
[6]
And even if, as pointed out by the petitioners, the ponente of the decision (Justice Minita V. Chico-Nazario) did not have the fullest opportunity to weigh conflicting testimonies, not having heard the witnesses testify and observed their deportment and manner of testifying, the Court finds no such misapprehension or misappreciation of facts committed by public respondent.
The fact that the judge who heard the evidence is not the one who rendered the judgment but merely relied on the records of the case does not render the judgment erroneous.
[7]
We are not convinced either that Evangelio falsely testified against the petitioners as no evil motive was attributed to him. A simple man, a farmer, like him could not have concocted a tale as detailed as his account of how the petitioners killed the victim. According to the Sandiganbayan, not an iota of evidence was adduced by the defense which would impress the court (Sandiganbayan) as to any bias on the part of Evangelio. Detailed testimony about a murder which could not have been concocted is highly qualitative.
[8]
As stated by public respondent -
""Evangelioâs account as to how the victim was killed was compatible with the kind of wound and their relative positions found in the latterâs remains. The Necropsy Report (Exh. ""A"") of NBI Medico-Legal Officer Dr. Ricardo H. Jaboneta, reveals that Bernardito sustained seven (7) gunshot wounds and three (3) stab wounds. Anent the gunshot wounds; one was located at the front, the six(6) others were located at the back of the victim. The gunshot wound at the front, which Dr. Jaboneta described as Gunshot wound No. 1, was located just below the clavicle, coincided with the declaration of Evangelio that George Arceno shot Bernardito, who was then facing him (George). The six (6) others gunshot wounds located at the back were sustained by Bernardito when he stood up after he was shot by George Arceno. Evangelio explained that after the first shot, Bernardito fell but was able to stand up. He was ordered to run but refused and remained standing. Moments after, he was fired at by Samson Arceno, Zaldy Arceno, and George Arceno who were then surrounding him. He struggled to his knees and held the thigh of Samson Arceno begging for mercy. In the process, the thigh of Samson Arceno was hit. He subsequently heard the group blaming Ecoy for having fired the shot while Bernardo was clinging to the thigh of Samson Arceno. It is not improbable that all those subsequent shots hit Bernardito at the back. Evangelio was corroborated by Bernardino Vencer, the victimâs uncle, whose house was located approximately 200 meters away and by Fernando Aguasa, an âherbularioâ who slept at Bernardoâs house that evening of April 26, 1986. The two asserted that about twenty minutes after the group, together with Bernardito, left the house of Bernardino, they heard a single shot. Afterwards, they heard successive shots from the direction where the group went.
With respect to the stab wounds, Dr. Ricardo Jaboneta narrated that Bernardito suffered three (3) stab wounds, two (2) were located at the back portion of the left shoulder and one (1) at the right scapular region. While Evangelio declared that he saw Pablo Bornales (upon the order of George Arceno) stab Bernardito on the head who was then lying prostrate on the ground, not on the shoulders (the woundsâ actual location), it will not invalidate or nullify his testimony. The Court considers the fact that the witness was then in a squatting position, 6Â½ to 15 meters away from the hut and observing the incident by peeping through the tall âtalahibâ grasses, parting them away from his face. Since the victim was then lying on the ground, while Pablo Bornales was in a squatting position, and the other accused crowded the victim, it would appear from where Evangelio was, that Bornales was stabbing the victim on the head.""
[9]
We likewise find the story of the accused (petitioners) to be incredible, absurd and repulsive to logic and reason. Thus, the Sandiganbayan declared:
""1. The accused alleged that the hut at Brgy. Calangag, Batad, was the hideout of Bernardo Vencer (or Bernardito) and his armed cohorts ( p. 27, TSN of June 23, 1992). Testimonial and documentary evidence presented by both the prosecution and the defense disclosed that with its physical condition, the hut could hardly be considered as a hide out. It measured about 2 Â½ by 3 Â½ meters only, no walls on all sides, thatched cogon roof, bamboo slats floor at knee high from the ground. While the accused made it to appear that the hut was hidden, evidence reveals that it was located at the edge of the promontory of a rolling hill, overlooking the wide expanse of ricefield some meters away. No fugitive in his right mind would dare make such an open, unwalled, fragile shack to be his hiding place, as he can easily be detected therein and it can never serve its purpose.
Apparently, as Edmundo Evangelio, the owner of the hut, testified, it was only his resting place where he spent his time after a hard work on his ricefield (pp. 6, 8, TSN of April 29, 1992).
2. Accusedâs version of self-defense is, to say the least, self-defeating. Accusedâs theory of self-defense is primarily anchored on the sole fact that Samson Arceno was hit on the thigh, thus necessitating them to hit, eventually killing the victim.
A. The accused particularly Samson Arceno and Marcelino Palma, Jr., contended that as they crawled towards the hut, they were fired upon by Bernardito, hitting Samson on the thigh, which prompted them to retaliate, so that there was an exchange of fire that ensued.
xxx    xxx    xxx
The scenario depicted by the accused can only be described as absurd and ridiculous. We cannot comprehend how it is possible for a person in the lower elevation to be shot at by another person in higher elevation, in prone position,
less than a meter away
(although later on Palma conceded to the Court that the distance was 1 Â½ meters away), to be hit on the thigh.
xxx    xxx    xxx
Upon the other hand, it was the testimony of witness Evangelio that it was while Bernardito was embracing the thigh of Samson Arceno and pleading for mercy, that Igmedio Ecoy, Jr. fired his gun, which hit Samson on the thigh which is compatible with the findings of Dr. Edwin Figura.
B. Accused averred that they cordoned the area by posting themselves in three (3) directions, Marcelino Palma and Samson Arceno on the western portion; George Arceno and Roberto Jino-o on the southern portion; and Noel Banico on the northern portion; that after Samson Arceno was shot, there was an exchange of fire between their group and Bernarditoâs group; that after the firing had ceased, they found one person dead which turned out to be Bernardito (pp. 25-26, TSN of June 22, 1994; p. 22-24, TSN of Feb. 15, 1993; pp. 13-17, TSN of Feb. 16, 1993).
The Court finds it incredible and highly unbelievable that the team composed of five (5) military men, four (4) were armed with armalites, one (1) with a .38 caliber revolver, surrounded the hut with allegedly four persons inside (this aspect, it is noticed, has not been seriously pursued) and would hit only one person, while the others fled away unharmed.
C. Team leader Marcelino S. Palma, Jr., declared that after he identified themselves as PC and police, the person inside the hut who turned out to be Bernardito shot him; that he was about
two meters
away from him (Bernardito) who was then already standing; that for almost five (5) minutes, there was an exchange of fire between his team and Bernarditoâs group (pp. 13-14, TSN of June 23, 1992).
Again this statement is absurd, and it is obvious that accused is telling a lie. We find it hard to believe that for such a very short distance between him and his assailant, and for five (5) minutes of exchanging fire, Palma was not hit. He did not even describe how he was able to avoid the bullets. In the exchange of fire that lasted for almost five minutes, and at a distance of about two (2) meters, how was it made possible that not one from his team men was hit, nay, even suffered a scratch?
D. Accused also maintained that they recovered from the body of Bernardito, one pistolized shot gun homemade, 12 gauge, and a double-bladed knife. We find it strange that they failed to present these items in evidence. Macelino S. Palma, Jr. declared that he turned over the recovered items to Station Commander of Batad Police Station Franklin Catequista and a corresponding receipt was issued, which he allegedly presented before the NAPOLCOM. The Court, however, doubts about the existence of said recovered items. If what witness said was true, they should have presented them as evidence in Court or at least, the receipt indicating their existence.
3. The team effected their mission to arrest Bernardo (or Bernardito) at night from 10:00 oâclock to 12:00 oâclock midnight. If, indeed, the purpose of the accused was only to apprehend Bernardo Vencer (or Bernardito), the Court finds it highly suspicious why they had done it at night time. Accused alleged that Bernardo Vencer (or Bernardito) was maintaining an armed group, all of them being notorious criminals. With this premise, why did they choose to arrest him at night, in a place where they were not so familiar, and heavy encounter was inevitable?
4. Lastly, the evidence adduced by the defense suffered from one material and harmful contradiction, among other, inconsistencies. While in all the testimonies of the accused, they stressed that Bernardo and Bernardito were one and the same person, they presented as their sur-rebuttal evidence, the documents which, and in effect, ironically supported the posture of the prosecution that they were two different persons. In a certification dated June 8, 1987 of Engr. Ben Lim, Jr., Vice President of RBL Fishing Corporation (Exh. ""12""), and other papers related thereto (Exhs. ""13"" & ""14""), it was stated that
Bernardo Vencer
died on November 6, 1979 when the vessel where he was employed as a seaman, sank in the high seas. This piece of information clearly established the theory that the accused were actually running after Bernardo Vencer, and not Bernardito Vencer, who, as shown by documentary evidence, was much different from Bernardo, in parentage, in birth dates in educational attainment, in background and in physical attributes (Exhs. ""K"" to ""Q"" and submarkings) but whom they believed to be one and the same person.""
[10]
Accused (petitioner) Zaldy Arceno asserts that he was not with the team that night as he was on guard duty at the headquarters of the 321st PC Company at Sara, Iloilo from 9:00 a.m., 25 April 1986, to 9:00 a.m. the following day, 26 April 1986.
The defense of alibi, being admittedly the weakest defense, cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused by prosecution witnesses. Positive identification prevails over the alibi of the accused, unless the latter can establish the physical impossibility of his presence at the place and time of the commission of the crime, either before, during, or after he was at such other place.
[11]
Accused Zaldy Arceno was positively identified by eyewitness Edmundo Evangelio to be one of the persons who brought Bernardito to his hut and later killed him. Zaldy was also positively identified by the victimâs uncle Bernardino Vencer to be in the group which picked up his nephew at his house in the evening of 25 April 1986 allegedly to be investigated at the Headquarters. Zaldy was also recognized by Fernando Aguasa, the ""herbolario"" who slept that night of 25 April 1986 at the house of Bernardino Vencer. As correctly appreciated by public respondent, Zaldyâs defense of alibi, apart from being uncorroborated, is unavailing against the positive identification made of him by the prosecution witnesses and the absence of physical impossibility of his being at the scene of the crime when it was committed.
We agree with public respondent that conspiracy was present in this case. Conspiracy need not be proved by direct evidence of prior agreement on the commission of the crime. It can be inferred from the conduct of the accused before, during, and after the commission of the crime, showing that they acted in unison with each other, evincing a common purpose or design.
[12]
The presence of the accused as a group, each of them armed, unquestionably gave encouragement and a sense of security among themselves. Where conspiracy is established, the act of one is the act of all.
It is evident that petitioners have sought a review by the Court of the factual findings of the Sandiganbayan, which essentially involve the credibility of the testimonies of the witnesses. As the issue of credibility is to be resolved primarily by the trial court, we see no reason to reverse the findings and conclusions made by the Sandiganbayan as they are supported by the testimonial and documentary evidence on record.
The prosecution evidence has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused (petitioners) indeed committed the crime of murder as charged.
WHEREFORE,
finding no reversible error committed by the Sandiganbayan in its judgments of conviction rendered against the accused (petitioners), the same is hereby
AFFIRMED
and the petition
DENIED.
Costs against petitioners.
SO ORDERED.

SECOND DIVISION
[ G.R. No. 103066, April 25, 1996 ]
WILLEX PLASTIC INDUSTRIES, CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. HON. COURT OF APPEALS AND INTERNATIONAL CORPORATE BANK, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N
MENDOZA, J.:
This is a petition for review on certiorari of the decision
[1]
of the Court of Appeals in C.A.-G.R. CV No. 19094, affirming the decision of the Regional Trial Court of the National Capital Judicial Region, Branch XLV, Manila, which ordered petitioner Willex Plastic Industries Corporation and the Inter-Resin Industrial Corporation, jointly and severally, to pay private respondent International Corporate Bank certain sums of money, and the appellate courtâs resolution of October 17, 1989 denying petitionerâs motion for reconsideration.
The facts are as follows:
Sometime in 1978, Inter-Resin Industrial Corporation opened a letter of credit with the Manila Banking Corporation. To secure payment of the credit accommodation, Inter-Resin Industrial and the Investment and Underwriting Corporation of the Philippines (IUCP) executed two documents, both entitled ""Continuing Surety Agreement"" and dated December 1, 1978, whereby they bound themselves solidarily to pay Manilabank ""obligations of every kind, on which the [Inter-Resin Industrial] may now be indebted or hereafter become indebted to the [Manilabank]."" The two agreements (Exhs. J and K) are the same in all respects, except as to the limit of liability of the surety, the first surety agreement being limited to US$333,830.00, while the second one is limited to US$334,087.00.
On April 2, 1979, Inter-Resin Industrial, together with Willex Plastic Industries Corp., executed a ""Continuing Guaranty"" in favor of IUCP whereby ""For and in consideration of the sum or sums obtained and/or to be obtained by Inter-Resin Industrial Corporation"" from IUCP, Inter-Resin Industrial and Willex Plastic jointly and severally guaranteed ""the prompt and punctual payment at maturity of the NOTE/S issued by the DEBTOR/S . . . to the extent of the aggregate principal sum of FIVE MILLION PESOS (P5,000,000.00) Philippine Currency and such interests, charges and penalties as hereafter may be specified.""
On January 7, 1981, following demand upon it, IUCP paid to Manilabank the sum of P4,334,280.61 representing Inter-Resin Industrialâs outstanding obligation. (Exh. M-1) On February 23 and 24, 1981, Atrium Capital Corp., which in the meantime had succeeded IUCP, demanded from Inter-Resin Industrial and Willex Plastic the payment of what it (IUCP) had paid to Manilabank. As neither one of the sureties paid, Atrium filed this case in the court below against Inter-Resin Industrial and Willex Plastic.
On August 11, 1982, Inter-Resin Industrial paid Interbank, which had in turn succeeded Atrium, the sum of P687,500.00 representing the proceeds of its fire insurance policy for the destruction of its properties.
In its answer, Inter-Resin Industrial admitted that the ""Continuing Guaranty"" was intended to secure payment to Atrium of the amount of P4,334,280.61 which the latter had paid to Manilabank. It claimed, however, that it had already fully paid its obligation to Atrium Capital.
On the other hand, Willex Plastic denied the material allegations of the complaint and interposed the following Special Affirmative Defenses:
(a) Assuming arguendo that main defendant is indebted to plaintiff, the formerâs liability is extinguished due to the accidental fire that destroyed its premises, which liability is covered by sufficient insurance assigned to plaintiff;
(b) Again, assuming arguendo, that the main defendant is indebted to plaintiff, its account is now very much lesser than those stated in the complaint because of some payments made by the former;
(c) The complaint states no cause of action against WILLEX;
(d) WILLEX is only a guarantor of the principal obligor, and thus, its liability is only secondary to that of the principal;
(e) Plaintiff failed to exhaust the ultimate remedy in pursuing its claim against the principal obligor;
(f) Plaintiff has no personality to sue.
On April 29, 1986, Interbank was substituted as plaintiff in the action. The case then proceeded to trial.
On March 4, 1988, the trial court declared Inter-Resin Industrial to have waived the right to present evidence for its failure to appear at the hearing despite due notice. On the other hand, Willex Plastic rested its case without presenting any evidence. Thereafter Interbank and Willex Plastic submitted their respective memoranda.
On April 5, 1988, the trial court rendered judgment, ordering Inter-Resin Industrial and Willex Plastic jointly and severally to pay to Interbank the following amounts:
(a) P3,646,780.61, representing their indebtedness to the plaintiff, with interest of 17% per annum from August 11, 1982, when Inter-Resin Industrial paid P687,500.00 to the plaintiff, until full payment of the said amount;
(b) Liquidated damages equivalent to 17% of the amount due; and
(c) Attorneyâs fees and expenses of litigation equivalent to 20% of the total amount due.
Inter-Resin Industrial and Willex Plastic appealed to the Court of Appeals. Willex Plastic filed its brief, while Inter-Resin Industrial presented a ""Motion to Conduct Hearing and to Receive Evidence to Resolve Factual Issues and to Defer Filing of the Appellantâs Brief."" After its motion was denied, Inter-Resin Industrial did not file its brief anymore.
On February 22, 1991, the Court of Appeals rendered a decision affirming the ruling of the trial court.
Willex Plastic filed a motion for reconsideration praying that it be allowed to present evidence to show that Inter-Resin Industrial had already paid its obligation to Interbank, but its motion was denied on December 6, 1991:
The motion is denied for lack of merit. We denied defendant-appellant Inter-Resin Industrialâs motion for reception of evidence because the situation or situations in which we could exercise the power under B.P. 129 did not exist. Movant here has not presented any argument which would show otherwise.
Hence, this petition by Willex Plastic for the review of the decision of February 22, 1991 and the resolution of December 6,1991 of the Court of Appeals.
Petitioner raises a number of issues.
[1] The main issue raised is whether under the ""Continuing Guaranty"" signed on April 2, 1979 petitioner Willex Plastic may be held jointly and severally liable with Inter-Resin Industrial for the amount paid by Interbank to Manilabank.
As already stated, the amount had been paid by Interbankâs predecessor-in-interest, Atrium Capital, to Manilabank pursuant to the ""Continuing Surety Agreements"" made on December 1, 1978. In denying liability to Interbank for the amount, Willex Plastic argues that under the ""Continuing Guaranty,"" its liability is for sums obtained by Inter-Resin Industrial from Interbank, not for sums paid by the latter to Manilabank for the account of Inter-Resin Industrial. In support of this contention Willex Plastic cites the following portion of the ""Continuing Guaranty"":
For and in consideration of the sums obtained and/or to be obtained by INTER-RESIN INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION, hereinafter referred to as the DEBTOR/S, from you
and/or your principal/s as may be evidenced by promissory note/s, checks, bills receivable/s and/or other evidence/s of indebtedness (hereinafter referred to as the NOTE/S), I/We hereby jointly and severally and unconditionally guarantee unto you and/or your principal/s, successor/s and assigns the prompt and punctual payment at maturity of the NOTE/S issued by the DEBTOR/S in your and/or your principal/s, successor/s and assigns favor to the extent of the aggregate principal sum of FIVE MILLION PESOS (P5,000,000.00), Philippine Currency, and such interests, charges and penalties as may hereinafter be specified.
The contention is untenable. What Willex Plastic has overlooked is the fact that evidence aliunde was introduced in the trial court to explain that it was actually to secure payment to Interbank (formerly IUCP) of amounts paid by the latter to Manilabank that the ""Continuing Guaranty"" was executed. In its complaint below, Interbankâs predecessor-in-interest. Atrium Capital, alleged:
5.  to secure the guarantee made by plaintiff of the credit accommodation granted to defendant IRIC [Inter-Resin Industrial] by Manilabank, the plaintiff required defendant IRIC [Inter-Resin Industrial] to execute a chattel mortgage in its favor and a Continuing Guaranty which was signed by the other defendant WPIC [Willex Plastic].
In its answer, Inter-Resin Industrial admitted this allegation although it claimed that it had already paid its obligation in its entirety. On the other hand, Willex Plastic, while denying the allegation in question, merely did so ""for lack of knowledge or information of the same."" But, at the hearing of the case on September 16, 1986, when asked by the trial judge whether Willex Plastic had not filed a crossclaim against Inter-Resin Industrial, Willex Plasticâs counsel replied in the negative and manifested that ""the plaintiff in this case [Interbank] is the guarantor and my client [Willex Plastic] only signed as a guarantor to the guarantee.""
[2]
For its part Interbank adduced evidence to show that the ""Continuing Guaranty"" had been made to guarantee payment of amounts made by it to Manilabank and not of any sums given by it as loan to Inter-Resin Industrial. Interbankâs witness testified under cross- examination by counsel for Willex Plastic that Willex ""guaranteed the exposure/of whatever exposure of ACP [Atrium Capital] will later be made because of the guarantee to Manila Banking Corporation.""
[3]
It has been held that explanatory evidence may be received to show the circumstances under which a document has been made and to what debt it relates.
[4]
At all events, Willex Plastic cannot now claim that its liability is limited to any amount which Interbank, as creditor, might give directly to Inter-Resin Industrial as debtor because, by failing to object to the parol evidence presented, Willex Plastic waived the protection of the parol evidence rule.
[5]
Accordingly, the trial court found that it was ""to secure the guarantee made by plaintiff of the credit accommodation granted to defendant IRIC [Inter-Resin Industrial] by Manilabank, [that] the plaintiff required defendant IRIC to execute a chattel mortgage in its favor and a Continuing Guaranty which was signed by the defendant Willex Plastic Industries Corporation.""
[6]
Similarly, the Court of Appeals found it to be an undisputed fact that ""to secure the guarantee undertaken by plaintiff-appellee [Interbank] of the credit accommodation granted to Inter-Resin Industrial by Manilabank, plaintiff-appellee required defendant-appellants to sign a Continuing Guaranty."" These factual findings of the trial court and of the Court of Appeals are binding on us not only because of the rule that on appeal to the Supreme Court such findings are entitled to great weight and respect but also because our own examination of the record of the trial court confirms these findings of the two courts.
[7]
Nor does the record show any other transaction under which Inter-Resin Industrial may have obtained sums of money from Interbank. It can reasonably be assumed that Inter-Resin Industrial and Willex Plastic intended to indemnify Interbank for amounts which it may have paid Manilabank on behalf of Inter-Resin Industrial.
Indeed, in its Petition for Review in this Court, Willex Plastic admitted that it was ""to secure the aforesaid guarantee, that INTERBANK required principal debtor IRIC [Inter-Resin Industrial] to execute a chattel mortgage in its favor, and so a âContinuing Guarantyâ was executed on April 2, 1979 by WILLEX PLASTIC INDUSTRIES CORPORATION (WILLEX for brevity) in favor of INTERBANK for and in consideration of the loan obtained by IRIC [Inter-Resin Industrial].""
[2] Willex Plastic argues that the ""Continuing Guaranty,"" being an accessory contract, cannot legally exist because of the absence of a valid principal obligation.
[8]
Its contention is based on the fact that it is not a party either to the ""Continuing Surety Agreement"" or to the loan agreement between Manilabank and Inter-Resin Industrial.
Put in another way the consideration necessary to support a surety obligation need not pass directly to the surety, a consideration moving to the principal alone being sufficient. For a ""guarantor or surety is bound by the same consideration that makes the contract effective between the principal parties thereto. . . . It is never necessary that a guarantor or surety should receive any part or benefit, if such there be, accruing to his principal.""
[9]
In an analogous case,
[10]
this Court held:
At the time the loan of P100,000.00 was obtained from petitioner by Daicor, for the purpose of having an additional capital for buying and selling coco-shell charcoal and importation of activated carbon, the comprehensive surety agreement was admittedly in full force and effect. The loan was, therefore, covered by the said agreement, and private respondent, even if he did not sign the promissory note, is liable by virtue of the surety agreement. The only condition that would make him liable thereunder is that the Borrower ""is or may become liable as maker, endorser, acceptor or otherwise."" There is no doubt that Daicor is liable on the promissory note evidencing the indebtedness.
The surety agreement which was earlier signed by Enrique Go, Sr. and private respondent, is an accessory obligation, it being dependent upon a principal one which, in this case is the loan obtained by Daicor as evidenced by a promissory note.
[3] Willex Plastic contends that the ""Continuing Guaranty"" cannot be retroactively applied so as to secure the payments made by Interbank under the two ""Continuing Surety Agreements."" Willex Plastic invokes the ruling m
El Vencedor v. Canlas
[11]
and
DiÃ±o v. Court of Appeals
[12]
in support of its contention that a contract of suretyship or guaranty should be applied prospectively.
The cases cited are, however, distinguishable from the present case. In
El Vencedor v. Canlas
we held that a contract of suretyship ""is not retrospective and no liability attaches for defaults occurring before it is entered into unless an intent to be so liable is indicated."" There we found nothing in the contract to show that the parties intended the surety bonds to answer for the debts contracted previous to the execution of the bonds. In contrast, in this case, the parties to the ""Continuing Guaranty"" clearly provided that the guaranty would cover ""sums
obtained
and/or to be obtained"" by Inter-Resin Industrial from Interbank.
On the other hand, in DiÃ±o v. Court of Appeals the issue was whether the sureties could be held liable for an obligation contracted after the execution of the continuing surety agreement. It was held that by its very nature a continuing suretyship contemplates a future course of dealing. ""It is prospective in its operation and is
generally
intended to provide security with respect to future transactions."" By no means, however, was it meant in that case that in all instances a contract of guaranty or suretyship should be prospective in application.
Indeed, as we also held in Bank of the
Philippine Islands v. Foerster,
[13]
although a contract of suretyship is ordinarily not to be construed as retrospective, in the end the intention of the parties as revealed by the evidence is controlling. What was said there
[14]
applies
mutatis mutandis
to the case at bar:
In our opinion, the appealed judgment is erroneous. It is very true that bonds or other contracts of suretyship are ordinarily not to be construed as retrospective, but that rule must yield to the intention of the contracting parties as revealed by the evidence, and does not interfere with the use of the ordinary tests and canons of interpretation which apply in regard to other contracts.
In the present case the circumstances so clearly indicate that the bond given by Echevarria was intended to cover all of the indebtedness of the Arrocera upon its current account with the plaintiff Bank that we cannot possibly adopt the view of the court below in regard to the effect of the bond.
[4] Willex Plastic says that in any event it cannot be proceeded against without first exhausting all property of Inter-Resin Industrial. Willex Plastic thus claims the benefit of excussion. The Civil Code provides, however:
Art. 2059. This excussion shall not take place:
(1) If the guarantor has expressly renounced it;
(2) If he has bound himself solidarily with the debtor;
..........................
The pertinent portion of the ""Continuing Guaranty"" executed by Willex Plastic and Inter-Resin Industrial in favor of IUCP (now Interbank) reads:
If default be made in the payment of the NOTE/s herein guaranteed you and/or your principal/s may directly proceed against Me/Us
without first proceeding against and exhausting DEBTOR/s properties
in the same manner as if all such liabilities constituted My/Our direct and primary obligations. (italics supplied)
This stipulation embodies an express renunciation of the right of excussion. In addition, Willex Plastic bound itself solidarily liable with Inter-Resin Industrial under the same agreement:
For and in consideration of the sums obtained and/or to be obtained by INTER-RESIN INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION, hereinafter referred to as the DEBTOR/S, from you and/or your principal/s as may be evidenced by promissory note/s, checks, bills receivable/s and/or other evidence/s of indebtedness (hereinafter referred to as the NOTE/S),
I/We hereby jointly and severally and unconditionally guarantee unto you
and/ or your principal/s, successor/s and assigns the prompt and punctual payment at maturity of the NOTE/S issued by the DEBTOR/S in your and/or your principal/s, successor/s and assigns favor to the extent of the aggregate principal sum of FIVE MILLION PESOS (P5,000,000.00), Philippine Currency, and such interests, charges and penalties as may hereinafter he specified.
[5] Finally it is contended that Inter-Resin Industrial had already paid its indebtedness to Interbank and that Willex Plastic should have been allowed by the Court of Appeals to adduce evidence to prove this. Suffice it to say that Inter-Resin Industrial had been given generous opportunity to present its evidence but it failed to make use of the same. On the other hand, Willex Plastic rested its case without presenting evidence.
The reception of evidence of Inter-Resin Industrial was set on January 29, 1987, but because of its failure to appear on that date, the hearing was reset on March 12, 26 and April 2, 1987.
On March 12, 1987 Inter-Resin Industrial again failed to appear. Upon motion of Willex Plastic, the hearings on March 12 and 26, 1987 were cancelled and ""reset for the last time"" on April 2 and 30, 1987.
On April 2, 1987, Inter-Resin Industrial again failed to appear. Accordingly the trial court issued the following order:
Considering that, as shown by the records, the Court had exerted every earnest effort to cause the service of notice or subpoena on the defendant Inter-Resin Industrial but to no avail, even with the assistance of the defendant Willex. . . the defendant Inter-Resin Industrial is hereby deemed to have waived the right to present its evidence.
On the other hand, Willex Plastic announced it was resting its case without presenting any evidence.
Upon motion of Inter-Resin Industrial, however, the trial court reconsidered its order and set the hearing anew on July 23, 1987. But Inter-Resin Industrial again moved for the postponement of the hearing to August 11, 1987. The hearing was, therefore, reset on September 8 and 22, 1987 but the hearings were reset on October 13,1987, this time upon motion of Interbank. To give Interbank time to comment on a motion filed by Inter-Resin Industrial, the reception of evidence for Inter-Resin Industrial was again reset on November 17, 26 and December 11, 1987. However, Inter-Resin Industrial again moved for the postponement of the hearing. Accordingly, the hearing was reset on November 26 and December 11, 1987, with warning that the hearings were intransferrable.
Again, the reception of evidence for Inter-Resin Industrial was reset on January 22, 1988 and February 5, 1988 upon motion of its counsel. As Inter-Resin Industrial still failed to present its evidence, it was declared to have waived its evidence.
To give Inter-Resin Industrial a last opportunity to present its evidence, however, the hearing was postponed to March 4, 1988. Again Inter-Resin Industrialâs counsel did not appear. The trial court, therefore, finally declared Inter-Resin Industrial to have waived the right to present its evidence. On the other hand, Willex Plastic, as before, manifested that it was not presenting evidence and requested instead for time to file a memorandum.
There is therefore no basis for the plea made by Willex Plastic that it be given the opportunity of showing that Inter-Resin Industrial has already paid its obligation to Interbank.

FIRST DIVISION
[ G.R. No. 111014, May 31, 1996 ]
LIANAâS SUPERMARKET,PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND NATIONAL LABOR UNION, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N
BELLOSILLO,J.:
LIANAâs SUPERMARKET, as its name implies, is a departmentized self-service retail market selling foods, convenience goods, and household merchandise with business outlets in Sucat, ParaÃ±aque, and Pasig City. Sometime in 1980, 1981 and 1982 it employed as sales ladies, cooks, packers, cashiers, electricians, warehousemen, etc., members of private respondent National Labor Union. However in the course of their employment they were allegedly underpaid and required, among others, to work more than eight (8) hours a day without overtime pay and deprived of legal holiday pay and monthly emergency allowance. Starting late 1982 and early 1983 they aired their grievances to petitioner through Peter Sy, its General Manager, and Rosa Sy, its Consultant, but were only scolded and threatened with outright dismissal. Consequently, they formed a labor union and affiliated it with respondent National Labor Union. Thereafter they demanded from petitioner recognition and compliance with existing labor laws.
On 30 April 1983 petitioner entered into a three-year contract with Warner Laputt, owner of BAVSPIA International Services, to supply petitioner with laborers.
About November and December 1984 Rosa Sy met with the employees individually and told them to quit their membership with the union under pain of being suspended, dismissed or criminally prosecuted. When they refused, many were dismissed without any charges and others were given memorandum on concocted offenses and violations.
Meanwhile in March and April 1984 petitioner through Peter Sy and Rosa Sy required the other employees to resign from employment and to accomplish information sheets and/or application forms with BAVSPIA otherwise they would be dismissed and/or not paid their salaries. With some degree of reluctance they complied. Nonetheless, they were allowed to continue working with petitioner under the same terms and conditions of their previous employment.
On 24 March 1984 respondent Union on behalf of its members filed a complaint against petitioner and/or Peter Sy, Rosa Sy, BAVSPIA and Warner Laputt before the Labor Arbiter for underpayment of wages, nonpayment of overtime pay, monthly emergency allowance, legal holiday pay, service incentive leave pay and 13th month pay (NLRC-NCR Case No. 3-1270-84). On 24 May 1984 the complaint was amended since respondent Union manifested through its authorized representative that it was intended as a class suit.
On 28 August 1984 another case was filed, docketed as NLRC-NCR Case No. 8-3043-84, with Elorde Padilla, Jr., et al., as complainants.
On 22 October 1984 a third case was filed, docketed as NLRC-NCR Case No. 10-3755-84, with Carmelita Reyes, Elizabeth Mahanlud, Danny Sida, Omar Napiri and Edgar Mahusay as individual complainants.
On 12 December 1984 still another case was filed, docketed as NLRC-NCR Case No. 12-4312-84, with Gloria Estoque and Estrellita Bansig as individual complainants.
Subsequently the four (4) cases were consolidated. Respondent National Labor Union submitted two (2) lists of one hundred thirty-six (136) workers, seventy-three (73) assigned at Sucat and sixty-three (63) at Pasig City. There were eighty-five (85) original complainants in the lists. However sixteen (16) complainants later filed motions to withdraw with prejudice and five (5) were found to be non-employees of petitioner. On 27 January 1987 three (3) other complainants settled with petitioner and moved to dismiss their complaints. Thus, a total of twenty-four (24) complainants were dropped from the lists thereby reducing the number to sixty-one (61).
But twenty-seven (27) more employees submitted their sworn statements thus increasing again the number of complainants to eighty-eight (88).
When petitioner learned of the charges before the Labor Arbiter it demanded the resignation of the employees from the Union and withdrawal of their cases or face criminal charges. It also threatened to withhold their wages and even to dismiss them from their employment. Since they refused to resign petitioner dismissed them. Hence, charges of unfair labor practice and illegal dismissal were added as causes of action in their complaints.
Petitioner contended that there was no unfair labor practice because there was no ongoing union activity before the alleged illegal dismissals; but even if there were, the dismissals were not effected by petitioner as complainants were not its employees but of BAVSPIA. If what were referred to as illegal dismissals were those of complainants who resigned, there can be no unfair labor practice as their resignations were voluntary and their applications with BAVSPIA were of their own volition.
On 6 February 1987, after the consolidated cases were submitted for decision, petitioner filed what was purportedly a compromise agreement between itself and the local chapter of respondent Union. It appeared to have been signed by representatives of petitioner and the President, Vice President and another officer of the local chapter of respondent Union with a prayer that the consolidated cases be dismissed.
BAVSPIA participated during the initial stages of the hearings but later moved to have its name dropped as co-respondent when it noted, after complainants have rested, that the evidence formally offered was directed only against petitioner.
On 28 February 1989 the Labor Arbiter held that (1) petitioner was the employer of complainants with BAVSPIA being engaged in labor-only contracting; (2) complainants were illegally dismissed; (3) Peter Sy and Rosa Sy were not personally liable; and, (4) the charge of unfair labor practice and all labor standards claims were unsubstantiated by evidence. Corollarily, petitioner was ordered to reinstate all the complainants and to pay them backwages and all benefits reckoned from the date of their respective dismissals until actual reinstatement but not to exceed three (3) years, and if reinstatement was no longer feasible the complainants should be granted separation pay equivalent to one-half month salary for every year of service, a fraction of at least six (6) months to be considered as one (1) whole year.
[1]
On 30 June 1993 public respondent National Labor Relations Commission affirmed the ruling of the Labor Arbiter.
[2]
The petitioner now asks how many individual complainants are there in these cases, whether seven (7) or eighty-five (85); whether these complainants were illegally dismissed; and, whether a compromise agreement with a motion to dismiss filed by a local chapter of respondent Union may be given legal effect.
Petitioner claims that there are only seven (7) individual complainants in these cases whose names appear in the captions of the decision of the Labor Arbiter. Anent thereto, petitioner argues that Sec. 3, Rule 6, of the Rules of Court clearly provides that the names and residences of the parties plaintiff and defendant must be stated in the complaint; similarly, Sec. 1, Rule III, of the New Rules of Procedure of respondent NLRC states that the full names of all the real parties in interest, whether natural or juridical persons or entities authorized by law, shall be stated in the caption of the complaint or petition as well as in the decision, award or judgment. Moreover, according to petitioner, these cases do not fall under the term ""class suit"" as defined in Sec. 12, Rule 3, of the Rules of Court because the parties are not so numerous that it would be impracticable to bring them all before the court. It is further the position of petitioner that BAVSPIA is the true employer of the complainants and the resignations of certain employees were voluntary. Petitioner still further argues that the compromise agreement duly signed by the officers of the local chapter of respondent Union and filed while the case was still pending before the Labor Arbiter is binding on all the complainants.
We disagree with petitioner. This is a ""representative suit"" as distinguished from ""class suit"" defined in Sec. 12, Rule 3, of the Rules of Court -
Sec. 12.
Class suit.
- When the subject matter of the controversy is one of common or general interest to many persons, and the parties are so numerous that it is impracticable to bring them all before the court, one or more may sue or defend for the benefit of all. But in such case the court shall make sure that the parties actually before it are sufficiently numerous and representative so that all interests concerned are fully protected. Any party in interest shall have a right to intervene in protection of his individual interest.
In Re:
Request of the Heirs of the Passengers of the DoÃ±a Paz to SetAside the Order Dated January 4, 1988 of Judge B. D. Chingcuangco,
[3]
the Court had occasion to explain ""class suit""-
What is contemplated, as will be noted, is that (a) the subject matter in controversy is of common or general interest to many persons, and (b) those persons are so numerous as to make it impracticable to bring them all before the court x x x What makes the situation a proper case for a class suit is the circumstance that there is
only one right or cause of action pertaining or belonging in common to many persons
(Italics supplied), not separately or severally to distinct individuals x x x The object of the suit is to obtain relief for or against numerous persons as a group or as an integral entity, and not as separate, distinct individuals whose rights or liabilities are separate from and independent of those affecting the others x x x The other factor that serves to distinguish the rule on class suits x x x is x x x the numerousness of parties involved x x x The rule is that for a class suit to be allowed, it is needful inter alia that the parties be so numerous that it would be impracticable to bring them all before the court.
In the present case, there are multiple rights or causes of action pertaining separately to several, distinct employees who are members of respondent Union. Therefore, the applicable rule is that provided in Sec. 3, Rule 3, of the Rules of Court on ""representative parties,"" which states ""
Sec. 3.
Representative parties.
- A trustee of an express trust, a guardian, executor or administrator, or a party authorized by statute (Italics supplied), may sue or be sued without joining the party for whose benefit the action is presented or defended; but the court may, at any stage of the proceedings, order such beneficiary to be made a party x x x.
One of the rights granted by Art. 242 of the Labor Code to a legitimate labor organization, like respondent Union, is to sue and be sued in its registered name. In
Liberty Manufacturing Workers Union v. Court of First Instance of Bulacan,
[4]
citing National Brewery and Allied Industries Labor Union of the Philippines v. San Miguel Brewery, Inc.,
[5]
and
Itogon-Suyoc Mines, Inc. v. Sangilo-Itogon Workersâ Union,
[6]
the Court held that the aforementioned provision authorizes a union to file a ""representative suit"" for the benefit of its members in the interest of avoiding an otherwise cumbersome procedure of joining all union members in the complaint, even if they number by the hundreds. The Court further rationalized that-
To hold otherwise and compel the 57 union members-employees to file 57 separate cases on their own individual and respective causes of action before the municipal court rather than through the present single collective action filed by petitioner union on their behalf and for their benefit would be to unduly clog the court dockets and slow down the prompt and expeditious determination of cases by the sheer number, time and volume of paper work that would be involved and required in disposing of 57 identical cases that could be adjudged in a
single
case such as that filed before the lower court.
What is worse then x x x by such an unrealistic approach, the courts would not keep faith with the Constitutional injunction to extend protection to labor x x x.
In another case,
Davao Free Workers Front v. Court of industrial Relations,
[7]
the Court stated that the detail that the number and names of the striking members of petitioner union were not specified in the decision nor in the complaint is of no consequence. Reiterating the rule in the
Liberty
case, the Court held that it was the function precisely of a labor union to carry the representation of its members and to file an action for their benefit and behalf without joining them and avoid the cumbersome procedure of joining each and every member as a separate party. Still, in
La Carlota Sugar Central v. Court of industrial Relations,
[8]
the Court emphasized that it would be an unwarranted impairment of the right to self-organization through formation of labor associations if thereafter such collective entities would be barred from instituting action in their representative capacity.
A ""representative suit"" is akin to a ""class suit"" in the limited sense that the phrases found in Sec. 12 of Rule 3,
""one or more may sue or defend for the benefit of all,""
and
""the parties actually before it are sufficiently numerous and representative,""
are similar to the phrase
""may sue or be sued witho ut joining the party for whose benefit the action is presented or defended""
found in Sec. 3 of the same Rule. In other words, both suits are always filed
in behalf
of another or others. That is why the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Apparently respondent Union, the Labor Arbiter and respondent Commission merely denominated the suit, although erroneously, as a ""class suit"" when, in reality, it is a ""representative suit."" Anyway, the issue as to the actual number of complainants in this case was correctly resolved by the Labor Arbiter with this ratiocination-
The very first complaint (No. 3-1270-84) filed in these consolidated cases was captioned National Labor Union for and in behalf of its members as complainants. It was dated March 24, 1984. When the same was amended on May 24, 1984, the same caption for complainants also appeared x x x Consistently with the instruction of said Arbiter as to the number of complainants allegedly prejudiced by the acts of respondents, their counsel submitted two lists (Exhs. A-i & A-2) containing a total of one hundred thirty-six names. However, said counsel submitted in evidence only around sixty affidavits of complainants, thereby giving credence to the allegation of respondents that not all those listed are actually complaining. Nonetheless and considering that respondents recognized that there are eighty-five complainants (Exhs. 48 & 49) we hold that the instant cases have been filed by the said Union for and in behalf of such number (85) of complainants.
[9]
Section 1, Rule III, of the NLRC New Rules of Procedure cited by petitioner is simply inapplicable because it was issued on 31 August 1990 or six (6) years after the complaints in these cases were filed in 1984.
The evidence clearly establishes that complainants were employed by petitioner. According to the Labor Arbiter-
As to the issue of which company is the employer of complainants, we hold that it is respondent Lianaâs. This is so because we find the co-respondent BAVSPIA engaged in labor-only contracting which is prohibited under the Labor Code.
[10]
Article 106, par. 4, of the Labor Code provides that there is ""labor-only contracting"" where the person supplying workers to an employer does not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, and the workers recruited and placed by such person are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of such employer. In such cases, the person or intermediary shall be considered merely as an agent of the employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent as if the latter were directly employed by him. The conclusion of the Labor Arbiter was bolstered by the fact that -
x x x even the employees who allegedly resigned from Lianaâs and applied/accepted by BAVSPIA were also re-assigned to Lianaâs. These employees were performing jobs which are necessary and desirable in the usual business or trade of Lianaâ s. Even the premises, tools and equipment used by the employees were those of Lianaâs. And, more important, these employees were under the control and supervision of said respondent Lianaâ s.
[11]
Likewise, the evidence sufficiently proves that complainants were illegally dismissed by petitioner-
Coming now to the main thrust of these complaints- the issue of illegal dismissal - we find that indeed the complainants were illegally dismissed. Respondentsâ contention that complainants were dismissed not by them but by BAVSPIA is untenable precisely because the latter was engaged in labor-only contracting. In this connection, respondent Lianaâs (has) not been able to show that the dismissals of complainants were for a just cause and, if ever, they were accorded due process. In short, said respondent Lianaâs failed to prove that their (its) mdismissals of complainants were justified.
xxx
The alleged resignation of thirty-three other complainants (who later applied to BAVSPIA) cannot be given effect, not because they were forced to do so but in view of our finding that said BAVSPIA was engaged in labor-only contracting. Hence, they could not have been working without any employer. Besides, resigned from Lianaâs and then apply to BAVSPIA only to be re-assigned later to the former, not to mention the glaring fact that all such letters of resignations are uniformly worded.
[12]
Before money claims can be the object of settlement through a union, the individual consent of the employees concerned should first be procured. This is because waiver of money claims is considered a personal right which must be protected by the courts on consideration of public policy. To really give teeth to the constitutional mandate of giving laborers maximum protection and security, they must be protected not only against their employer but also against the leaders of their own labor union. Thus, in
General Rubber and Footwear Corporation v. Drilon,
[13]
citing
Kaisahan ng Manggagawa sa La Campana v. Sarmiento,
[14]
it was held-
Money claims due to laborers cannot be the object of settlement or compromise effected by a union or counsel without the specific individual consent of each laborer concerned. The beneficiaries are the individual complainants themselves. The union to which they belong can only assist them but cannot decide for them x x x.
There is no evidence on record that the compromise agreement was approved by the complainants individually. The document does not bear their signatures except those of the local Unionâs President, Vice President and another officer. Neither is there evidence to show that the compromise agreement was ever approved by the Labor Arbiter. Clearly then, it cannot bind the complainants.
The grave abuse of discretion imputed to public respondent NLRC does not exist. But the alternative award of separation pay granted by the Labor Arbiter in an amount equivalent to one-half month salary for every year of service must be modified. It has been our consistent ruling that in awarding separation pay to an illegally dismissed employee, in lieu of reins tatement, the amount to be awarded shall be equivalent to one month salary for every year of service.
[15]
We have no reason to hold otherwise.
WHEREFORE,
the resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission dated 30 June 1993 affirming the decision of the Labor Arbiter dated 28 February 1989 is
AFFIRMED,
subject to the modification that the separation pay granted as an alternative relief shall be equivalent to one-month salary for every year of service, a fraction of at least six (6) months to be considered one (1) whole year. Costs against petitioner.
SO ORDERED.

R E S O L U T I O N
HERMOSISIMA, JR., J.:
The herein petition was filed by the Halili Bus Drivers and Conductors Union (PTGWO), under the caption of the original case/cases,
[1]
as it may in fact be considered an incident thereto.
The above-captioned cases were claims for unpaid overtime pay of 897 union members against Fortunato Halili, then doing business under the name and style, Halili Transit which were initially commenced as a complaint
[2]
with the defunct Court of Industrial Relations on
August 20, 1958.
After Fortunato Haliliâs demise, said cases were settled amicably. The Union and the Administratrix of Fortunato F. Haliliâs estate reached an Agreement on December 23, 1974, the pertinent portions of which read:
""xxx                 xxx                xxx
WHEREAS, in the face of this strong urging on the part of the Supreme Court Justices upon the parties to put an immediate end to this case by amicable settlement, the parties repeatedly came to conference, conscientiously explored all avenues of settlement, and finally arrived at the tentative agreement (tentative because of the condition that the same be sanctioned by the court in the estate case) whereby the Administratrix would transfer to the employees title to that tract of land, covered by TCT No. 36389, containing an area of approximately 33,952 square meters, situated in the Barrio of San Bartolome, Municipality of Caloocan, Province of Rizal, and pay in addition the cash amount of P25,000.00 in full and final satisfaction of all the claims and causes of action of all of the employees against the estate of Fortunato F. Halili, subject of CIR Case No. 1099-V.
xxx                  xxx                  xxx
âNOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the foregoing and of the covenants, stipulations and undertakings hereinafter contained, the parties have agreed as follows:
1. The UNION, its officers and members-claimants relative to CIR Case No. 1099-V. shall withdraw and dismiss with prejudice Case No. 1099-V filed by the UNION in behalf of its members-claimants before the Court of Industrial Relations and all its incidents thereto.
2. The ESTATE shall deliver or cause to be delivered, to the UNION the following:
(a) Deed of Transfer of a parcel of land situated in Barrio San Bartolome, Caloocan City, containing an area of THIRTY-THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO (33,952) Square Meters, more or less, and covered by Transfer Certificate of title No. 35389 of the Registry of Deeds of Rizal, to be made, upon authority and approval granted by the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch IV, at Quezon City, in Proc. No. Q-10852 in the name of the Halili Bus Drivers & Conductors Union (PTGWO), free from any and all liens, encumbrances, and any and all claims whatsoever.
(b) Negotiable Check for TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND (P25,000.00) PESOS in the name of Domingo D. Cabading, President of the UNION.
3. The transfer of the above-described parcel of land and receipt of the amount of P25,000.00 constitute the full and final satisfaction of the claims and award in said CIR Case No. 1099-V, as well as any and all attorneyâs liens in said case, for and in consideration of which the UNION members- claimants in CIR Case No. 1099-V by these presents now and forever release and quitclaim Halili Enterprises, Halili Transit, Fortunato F. Halili, his estate, heirs and successors by reason of CIR Case No. 1099-V, it being their intention that they be absolutely, completely and finally absolved and released from any and all liability in said case, including attorneyâs liens, the transfer of the property and payment of the amount hereinabove stated constituting for all intents and purposes a full, final and complete settlement and satisfaction of the award in CIR Case No. 1099-V and all incidents thereto.
4. The UNION and its undersigned officers hereby warrant that the UNION is a duly registered labor organization and that in a special meeting called for the purpose they were duly authorized on December 22, 1974, by all the members-claimants in CIR Case No. 1099-V to sign this Memorandum of Agreement with Release and Quitclaim which was unanimously approved and ratified by said members-claimants as evidenced by a Resolution dated December 22, 1974, a copy of which is attached hereto and made a part hereof as Annex âBâ, and hereby jointly and severally hold the estate and heirs of Fortunato F. Halili free and harmless from, and undertake to indemnify them for any and all liability for any claims by members of the UNION, their heirs, assigns and agents relating to CIR Case No. 1099-V or attorneyâs liens in connection therewithâ
(69 SCRA 509- 510).""
[3]
On January 6, 1975, pursuant to the abovementioned Agreement, the Administratrix of the Estate of Fortunato F. Halili executed a Deed of Conveyance of Real Property, transferring the aforementioned parcel of land to the Halili Bus and Conductors Union (PTGWO) in trust for the individual members of the Union claimants.
The parcel of land covered by the said Deed of Conveyance was registered without encumbrance in the name of the said Union on February 14, 1975 under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 205755.
[4]
On August 9, 1982, the said Union, through its legal counsel, Atty. Benjamin C. Pineda, filed an urgent motion with the then Ministry of Labor and Employment (MOLE) requesting that authority be granted to sell and dispose of the property.
On September 23, 1982, the MOLE acting through Labor Arbiter Raymundo R. Valenzuela, granted the Unionâs motion to sell the subject property.
Thereafter, Atty. Benjamin C. Pineda filed a motion with the Supreme Court on December 1, 1982, requesting authority to sell the property. This Court, however, merely noted the motion in a Resolution dated December 8, 1982.
Relying on the earlier authority given him by the Ministry of Labor, Atty. Pineda subsequently filed another urgent motion with the MOLE, this time praying that the Union be authorized to sell the lot to the respondent herein Manila Memorial Park Cemetery, Inc. (MMPCI, for brevity).
In an Order, dated February 9, 1983, Labor Arbiter Valenzuela, for the MOLE, likewise granted the motion to sell the subject property to MMPCI.
The sale of the property held in trust by the seller-Union to the buyer-MMPCI was finally consummated on June 7, 1983.
On the basis of the Order of Arbiter Valenzuela and the Deed of Sale between the Union and MMPCI, Transfer Certificate of Title No. 205755 in the name of the Union was canceled and said property was registered in the name of respondent MMPCI, under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 301151 by the Register of Deeds of Quezon City on June 14, 1983.
Significantly, however, the Orders, dated September 23, 1982 and February 9, 1983, issued by Labor Arbiter Valenzuela which granted the two motions of the Unionâs former counsel, Atty. Benjamin C. Pineda, for an authority to sell the real property awarded to the Union, were set aside by this Court in a Resolution, dated October 18, 1983, to wit:
""[A]nd considering that, as affirmed by the Solicitor General, the challenged orders of Arbiter Raymundo R. Valenzuela dated September 23, 1982 and February 9, 1983, were issued without due process of law, the COURT RESOLVED (1) to set aside as null and void said orders of September 23, 1982 and February 9, 1983 of Arbiter Raymundo R. Valenzuela x x x.
[5]
On the basis of this Resolution nullifying the above orders of the Labor Arbiter, the Union filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) seeking to compel the buyer, private respondent Manila Memorial Park Cemetery, Inc., to reconvey the Unionâs property bought by MMPCI from Atty. Pineda upon the ground that the latter sold it without proper authority from the Supreme Court.
The Chief of the Legal and Enforcement Division of the NLRC, tasked to act on the complaint, refused to take cognizance of the case for lack of jurisdiction, viz:
""The instant complaint does not fall under the jurisdictional ambit of this Commission (NLRC) or any labor forum. It is our considered view that the cause of action raised herein is a proper subject of the regular courts.""
[6]
Hence, the Union filed this Petition/Motion with Prayer for Clarification, through which it seeks, among others, the recovery of subject real property comprising of 33,952 square meters sold to respondent MMPCI, to wit:
""3. That the Petition/Motion with Prayer for Clarification in this subject complaint claim for recovery of the Union Real Property in trust as provided in the provisions in the Union General Resolution dated January 21, 1986, was a valid and verified cause of action of the union-members/co-owners of the said union real property in trust to be recovered and take possession due to the ground that the sale of said union real property was sold by persons without authority to sell from the owners of said property or acquired authority to sell from the Supreme Court or Court of jurisdiction being that this union real property in trust was sold in a means of purely illegal sale.""
[7]
The petition has no merit.
I
Article 217 of the Labor Code, as amended by Section 9 of Republic Act 6715 delineates the scope ofjurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Commission and the Labor Arbiters, to wit:
""ART. 217. Jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters and the Commission (a) Except as otherwise provided under this Code the Labor Arbiters shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide, within thirty (30) calendar days after the submission of the case by the parties for decision without extension, even in the absence of stenographic notes, the following cases involving all workers, whether agricultural or non-agricultural:
1. Unfair labor practice cases;
2. Termination disputes;
3. If accompanied with a claim for reinstatement, those cases that workers may file involving wages, rates of pay, hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment;
4. Claims for actual, moral, exemplary and other forms of damages arising from the employer-employee relations;
5. Cases arising from any violation of Article 264 of this Code, including questions involving the legality of strikes and lockouts; and
6. Except claims for Employees Compensation, Social Security, Medicare and maternity benefits, all other claims, arising from employer-employee relations, including those of persons in domestic or household service, involving an amount exceeding five thousand pesos (P5,000.00) regardless of whether accompanied with a claim for reinstatement.
(b) The Commission shall have exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all cases decided by Labor Arbiters.
(c) Cases arising from the interpretation or implementation of collective bargaining agreements and those arising from the interpretation or enforcement of company personnel policies shall be disposed of by the Labor Arbiter by referring the same to the grievance machinery and voluntary arbitration as may be provided in said agreements.""
The subject matter of the instant petition, which is the reconveyance of the disputed real property to the Union by the respondent MMPCI does not fall under any of the issues cognizable by the NLRC as enumerated in Article 217 of the Labor Code. Hence, the public respondent NLRC committed no error in dismissing the complaint brought before them by the petitioner Union for the simple reason that said Tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain the same.
II
The fact that the subject real property was registered under the Torrens System of registration in the name of respondent MMPCI under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 301151 by the Register of Deeds of Quezon City on June 14, 1983, makes the instant petition all the more dismissible, considering that the best proof of ownership of a piece of land is the Certificate of Title.
[8]
Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. 1529, otherwise known as the Property Registration Decree provides:
""SEC. 48. Certificate not subject to collateral attack. -A certificate of title shall not be subject to collateral attack. It cannot be altered, modified, or canceled except in a direct proceeding in accordance with law.""
A certificate of title accumulates in one document a precise and correct statement of the exact status of the fee held by its owner. The certificate, in the absence of fraud, is the evidence of title and shows exactly the real interest of its owner. The title once registered, with very few exceptions, should not thereafter be impugned, altered, changed, modified, enlarged, or diminished, except in some direct proceeding permitted by law. Otherwise, all security in registered titles would be lost.
[9]
In the present petition, the Union seeks from respondent MMPCI the recovery of the subject property. It is evident that the objective of such claim is to nullify the title of private respondent to the property in question, which thereby challenges the judgment pursuant to which the title was decreed. This is apparently a collateral attack which is not permitted under the principle of indefeasibility of a Torrens Title. It is well settled that a Torrens Title cannot be collaterally attacked. The issue on the
validity of title,
i.e., whether or not it was fraudulently issued, can only be raised in an action expressly instituted for that purpose. Hence, whether or not petitioners have the right to claim ownership of the land in question is beyond the province of the instant proceeding.
[10]
III
Furthermore, all portions of said land, now known as Holy Cross Memorial Park, have already been sold out to individual lot buyers, who are innocent purchasers for value, and contain the interred remains of the lot owners and/or their relatives. Where innocent third persons, relying on the correctness of the Certificate of Title thus issued, acquire rights over the property, the Court cannot disregard such rights and order the total cancellation of the certificate. The effect of such an outright cancellation would be to impair public confidence in the Certificate of Title, for everyone dealing with property registered under the Torrens System would have to inquire in every instance as to whether the title has been regularly or irregularly issued by the Court. And this is contrary to the evident purpose of the law. Every person dealing with registered land may safely rely on the correctness of the Certificate of Title issued there for and the law will in no way oblige him to go behind the certificate to determine the condition of the property.
[11]
IV
As adverted to earlier, ownership of the lot in question had already been vested in the Union upon sale to it by the Heirs of Halili. Considering this, the Union had every right to dispose of the property. After the termination of the above-entitled cases, judgment therefor having become final and executory, even as of 1982, neither the NLRC nor this Court will have any authority to look into the validity of the disposal by the Union of the property so acquired by the Union in the proceedings. Under the circumstances, therefore, it is to be assumed that the sale by the Union, as virtual owner of the property, to the respondent MMPCI would not need any authority to sell from the NLRC or from this Court and we hereby write finis to these cases in order to avoid multiplicity of suits and considering that these cases were instituted as early as 1958.
WHEREFORE,
the instant petition is
DISMISSED
for lack of merit.
Costs against the petitioner.
SO ORDERED.

D E C I S I O N
HERMOSISIMA, JR., J.:
The corporate mask may be lifted and the corporate veil may be pierced when a corporation is just but the alter ego of a person or of another corporation. Where badges of fraud exist; where public convenience is defeated; where a wrong is sought to be justified thereby, the corporate fiction or the notion of legal entity should come to naught. The law in these instances will regard the corporation as a mere association of persons and, in case of two corporations, merge them into one.
Thus, where a sister corporation is used as a shield to evade a corporationâs subsidiary liability for damages, the corporation may not be heard to say that it has a personality separate and distinct from the other corporation. The piercing of the corporate veil comes into play.
This special civil action ostensibly raises the question of whether the National Labor Relations Commission committed grave abuse of discretion when it issued a ""break-open order"" to the sheriff to be enforced against personal property found in the premises of petitionerâs sister company.
Petitioner Concept Builders, Inc., a domestic corporation, with principal office at 355 Maysan Road, Valenzuela, Metro Manila, is engaged in the construction business. Private respondents were employed by said company as laborers, carpenters and riggers.
On November, 1981, private respondents were served individual written notices of termination of employment by petitioner, effective on November 30, 1981. It was stated in the individual notices that their contracts of employment had expired and the project in which they were hired had been completed.
Public respondent found it to be, the fact, however, that at the time of the termination of private respondentâs employment, the project in which they were hired had not yet been finished and completed. Petitioner had to engage the services of sub-contractors whose workers performed the functions of private respondents.
Aggrieved, private respondents filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, unfair labor practice and non-payment of their legal holiday pay, overtime pay and thirteenth-month pay against petitioner.
On December 19, 1984, the Labor Arbiter rendered judgment
[1]
ordering petitioner to reinstate private respondents and to pay them back wages equivalent to one year or three hundred working days.
On November 27, 1985, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) dismissed the motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner on the ground that the said decision had already become final and executory.
[2]
On October 16, 1986, the NLRC Research and Information Department made the finding that private respondentsâ backwages amounted to P199,800.00.
[3]
On October 29, 1986, the Labor Arbiter issued a writ of execution directing the sheriff to execute the Decision, dated December 19, 1984. The writ was partially satisfied through garnishment of sums from petitionerâs debtor, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage Authority, in the amount of P81,385.34. Said amount was turned over to the cashier of the NLRC.
On February 1, 1989, an Alias Writ of Execution was issued by the Labor Arbiter directing the sheriff to collect from herein petitioner the sum of P117,414.76, representing the balance of the judgment award, and to reinstate private respondents to their former positions.
On July 13, 1989, the sheriff issued a report stating that he tried to serve the alias writ of execution on petitioner through the security guard on duty but the service was refused on the ground that petitioner no longer occupied the premises.
On September 26, 1986, upon motion of private respondents, the Labor Arbiter issued a second alias writ of execution.
The said writ had not been enforced by the special sheriff because, as stated in his progress report, dated November 2, 1989:
1. All the employees inside petitionerâs premises at 355 Maysan Road, Valenzuela, Metro Manila, claimed that they were employees of Hydro Pipes Philippines, Inc. (HPPI) and not by respondent;
2. Levy was made upon personal properties he found in the premises;
3. Security guards with high-powered guns prevented him from removing the properties he had levied upon.
[4]
The said special sheriff recommended that a ""break-open order"" be issued to enable him to enter petitionerâs premises so that he could proceed with the public auction sale of the aforesaid personal properties on November 7, 1989.
On November 6, 1989, a certain Dennis Cuyegkeng filed a third-party claim with the Labor Arbiter alleging that the properties sought to be levied upon by the sheriff were owned by Hydro (Phils.), Inc. (HPPI) of which he is the Vice-President.
On November 23, 1989, private respondents filed a ""Motion for Issuance of a Break-Open Order,"" alleging that HPPI and petitioner corporation were owned by the same incorporator! stockholders. They also alleged that petitioner temporarily suspended its business operations in order to evade its legal obligations to them and that private respondents were willing to post an indemnity bond to answer for any damages which petitioner and HPPI may suffer because of the issuance of the break-open order.
In support of their claim against HPPI, private respondents presented duly certified copies of the General Informations Sheet, dated May 15, 1987, submitted by petitioner to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the General Information Sheet, dated May 15, 1987, submitted by HPPI to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The General Information Sheet submitted by the petitioner1 revealed the following:

On February 1, 1990, HPPI filed an Opposition to private respondentsâ motion for issuance of a break-open order, contending that HPPI is a corporation which is separate and distinct from petitioner. HPPI also alleged that the two corporations are engaged in two different kinds of businesses, i.e., HPPI is a manufacturing firm while petitioner was then engaged in construction.
On March 2, 1990, the Labor Arbiter issued an Order which denied private respondentsâ motion for break-open order.
Private respondents then appealed to the NLRC. On April 23, 1992, the NLRC set aside the order of the Labor Arbiter, issued a break-open order and directed private respondents to file a bond. Thereafter, it directed the sheriff to proceed with the auction sale of the properties already levied upon. It dismissed the third-party claim for lack of merit.
Petitioner moved for reconsideration but the motion was denied by the NLRC in a Resolution, dated December 3, 1992.
Hence, the resort to the present petition.
Petitioner alleges that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion when it ordered the execution of its decision despite a third-party claim on the levied property. Petitioner further contends, that the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil should not have been applied, in this case, in the absence of any showing that it created HPPI in order to evade its liability to private respondents. It also contends that HPPI is engaged in the manufacture and sale of steel, concrete and iron pipes, a business which is distinct and separate from petitionerâs construction business. Hence, it is of no consequence that petitioner and HPPI shared the same premises, the same President and the same set of officers and subscribers.
[7]
We find petitionerâs contention to be unmeritorious.
It is a fundamental principle of corporation law that a corporation is an entity separate and distinct from its stockholders and from other corporations to which it may be connected.
[8]
But, this separate and distinct personality of a corporation is merely a fiction created by law for convenience and to promote justice.
[9]
So, when the notion of separate juridical personality is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud or defend crime, or is used as a device to defeat the labor laws,
[10]
this separate personality of the corporation may be disregarded or the veil of corporate fiction pierced.
[11]
This is true likewise when the corporation is merely an adjunct, a business conduit or an alter ego of another corporation.
[12]
The conditions under which the juridical entity may be disregarded vary according to the peculiar facts and circumstances of each case. No hard and fast rule can be accurately laid down, but certainly, there are some probative factors of identity that will justify the application of the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, to wit:
""1. Stock ownership by one or common ownership of both corporations.
2.Identity of directors and officers.
3.The manner of keeping corporate books and records.
4.Methods of conducting the business.""
[13]
The SEC en banc explained the ""instrumentality rule"" which the courts have applied in disregarding the separate juridical personality of corporations as follows:
""Where one corporation is so organized and controlled and its affairs are conducted so that it is, in fact, a mere instrumentality or adjunct of the other, the fiction of the corporate entity of the âinstrumentalityâ may be disregarded. The control necessary to invoke the rule is not majority or even complete stock control but such domination of finances, policies and practices that the controlled corporation has, so to speak, no separate mind, will or existence of its own, and is but a conduit for its principal. It must be kept in mind that the control must be shown to have been exercised at the time the acts complained of took place. Moreover, the control and breach of duty must proximately cause the injury or unjust loss for which the complaint is made.""
The test in determining the applicability of the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction is as follows:
""1. Control, not mere majority or complete stock control, but complete domination, not only of finances but of policy and business practice in respect to the transaction attacked so that the corporate entity as to this transaction had at the time no separate mind, will or existence of its own;
2. Such control must have been used by the defendant to commit fraud or wrong, to perpetuate the violation of a statutory or other positive legal duty, or dishonest and unjust act in contravention of plaintiffâs legal rights; and
3. The aforesaid control and breach of duty must proximately cause the injury or unjust loss complained of.
The absence of any one of these elements prevents âpiercing the corporate veil. â in applying the âinstrumentalityâ or âalter egoâ doctrine, the courts are concerned with reality and not form, with how the corporation operated and the individual defendantâs relationship to that operation. ""
[14]
Thus, the question of whether a corporation is a mere alter ego, a mere sheet or paper corporation, a sham or a subterfuge is purely one of fact.
[15]
In this case, the NLRC noted that, while petitioner claimed that it ceased its business operations on April 29, 1986, it filed an Information Sheet with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, 1987, stating that its office address is at 355 Maysan Road, Valenzuela, Metro Manila. On the other hand, HPPI, the third-party claimant, submitted on the same day, a similar information sheet stating that its office address is at 355 Maysan Road, Valenzuela, Metro Manila.
Furthermore, the NLRC stated that:
""Both information sheets were filed by the same Virgilio O. Casino as the corporate secretary of both corporations. It would also not be amiss to note that both corporations had the same president, the same board of directors, the
same
corporate officers, and substantially the same subscribers.
From the foregoing, it appears that, among other things, the respondent (herein petitioner) and the third-party claimant shared the
same
address and/or premises. Under this circumstances, (sic) it cannot be said that the property levied upon by the sheriff were not of respondents.
[16]
Clearly, petitioner ceased its business operations in order to evade the payment to private respondents of backwages and to bar their reinstatement to their former positions. HPPI is obviously a business conduit of petitioner corporation and its emergence was skillfully orchestrated to avoid the financial liability that already attached to petitioner corporation.
The facts in this case are analogous to
Claparols v. Court of Industrial Relations
[17]
where we had the occasion to rule:
""Respondent courtâs findings that indeed the Claparols Steel and Nail Plant, which ceased operation of June 30, 1957, was SUCCEEDED by the Claparols Steel Corporation effective the next day, July 1, 1957, up to December 7, 1962, when the latter finally ceased to operate, were not disputed by petitioner. it is very clear that the latter corporation was a continuation and successor of the first entity x x x. Both predecessors and successor were owned and controlled by petitioner Eduardo Claparols and there was no break in the succession and continuity of the same business. This âavoiding-the-liabilityâ scheme is very patent, considering that 90% of the subscribed shares of stock of the Claparols Steel Corporation (the second corporation) was owned by respondent x x x Claparols himself, and all the assets of the dissolved Claparols Steel and Nail Plant were turned over to the emerging Claparols Steel Corporation.
It is very obvious that the second corporation seeks the protective shield of a corporate fiction whose veil in the present case could, and should, be pierced as it was deliberately and maliciously designed to evade its financial obligation to its employees.""
In view of the failure of the sheriff, in the case at bar, to effect a levy upon the property subject of the execution, private respondents had no other recourse but to apply for a break-open order after the third-party claim of HPPI was dismissed for lack of merit by the NLRC. This is in consonance with Section 3, Rule VII of the NLRC Manual of Execution of Judgment which provides that:
""Should the losing party, his agent or representative, refuse or prohibit the Sheriff or his representative entry to the place where the property subject of execution is located or kept, the judgment creditor may apply to the Commission or Labor Arbiter concerned for a break-open order.""
Furthermore, our perusal of the records shows that the twin requirements of due notice and hearing were complied with. Petitioner and the third-party claimant were given the opportunity to submit evidence in support of their claim.
Hence, the NLRC did not commit any grave abuse of discretion when it affirmed the break-open order issued by the Labor Arbiter.
Finally, we do not find any reason to disturb the rule that factual findings of quasi-judicial agencies supported by substantial evidence are binding on this Court and are entitled to great respect, in the absence of showing of grave abuse of a discretion.

the petition is
DISMISSED

FIRST DIVISION
[ G.R. No. 112331, May 29, 1996 ]
ANASTACIA QUIMEN, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND YOLANDA Q. OLIVEROS, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N
BELLOSILLO,J.:
IN EASEMENT OF RIGHT OF WAY that easement where the way is shortest and will cause least prejudice shall be chosen. However, if the two circumstances do not concur in a single tenement, the way where damage will be least shall be used even if not the shortest route.
[1]
This is so because
least prejudice
prevails over shortest distance. This means that the court is not bound to establish what is the
shortest distance
; a longer way may be adopted to avoid injury to the servient estate, such as when there are constructions or walls which can be avoided by a round about way, or to secure the interest of the dominant owner, such as when the shortest distance would place the way on a dangerous decline.
Thus we conclude from the succeeding facts: Petitioner Anastacia Quimen together with her brothers Sotero, Sulpicio, Antonio and sister Rufina inherited a piece of property situated in Pandi, Bulacan. They agreed to subdivide the property equally among themselves, as they did, with the shares of Anastacia, Sotero, Sulpicio and Rufina abutting the municipal road. The share of Anastacia, located at the extreme left, was designated as Lot No. 1448-B- 1. It is bounded on the right by the property of Sotero designated as Lot. No. 1448-B-2. Adjoining Soteroâs property on the right are Lots Nos. 1448-B-3 and 1448-B-4 originally owned by Rufina and Sulpicio, respectively, but which were later acquired by a certain Catalina Santos. Located directly behind the lots of Anastacia and Sotero is the share of their brother Antonio designated as Lot No. 1448-B-C which the latter divided into two (2) equal parts, now Lots Nos. 1448-B-6-A and 1448-B-6-B, each with an area of 92 square meters. Lot No. 1448-B-6-A is located behind Anastaciaâs Lot No. 1448-B-1, while Lot No. 1448-B-6-B is behind the property of Sotero, father of respondent Yolanda.
In February 1982 Yolanda purchased Lot No. 1448-B-6-A from her uncle Antonio through her aunt Anastacia who was then acting as his administratrix. According to Yolanda, when petitioner offered her the property for sale she was hesitant to buy as it had no access to a public road. But Anastacia prevailed upon her to buy the lot with the assurance that she would give her a right of way on her adjoining property for P200.00 per square meter.
Thereafter, Yolanda constructed a house on the lot she bought using as her passageway to the public highway a portion of Anastaciaâ s property. But when Yolanda finally offered to pay for the use of the pathway Anastacia refused to accept the payment. In fact she was thereafter barred by Anastacia from passing through her property.
[2]
In February 1986 Yolanda purchased the other lot of Antonio Quimen, Lot No. 1448-B-6-B, located directly behind the property of her parents who provided her a pathway
gratis et amore
between their house, extending about nineteen (19) meters from the lot of Yolanda behind the
sari-sari store
of Sotero, and Anastaciaâs perimeter fence. The store is made of strong materials and occupies the entire frontage of the lot measuring four (4) meters wide and nine meters (9) long. Although the pathway leads to the municipal road it is not adequate for ingress and egress. The municipal road cannot be reached with facility because the store itself obstructs the path so that one has to pass through the back entrance and the facade of the store to reach the road.
On 29 December 1987 Yolanda filed an action with the proper court praying for a right of way through Anastaciaâ s property. An ocular inspection upon instruction of the presiding judge was conducted by the branch clerk of court. The report was that the proposed right of way was at the extreme right of Anastaciaâs property facing the public highway, starting from the back of Soteroâs
sari-sari store
and extending inward by one (1) meter to her property and turning left for about five (5) meters to avoid the store of Sotero in order to reach the municipal road
[3]
and the way was unobstructed except for an avocado tree standing in the middle.
[4]
But on 5 September 1991 the trial court dismissed the complaint for lack of cause of action, explaining that the right of way through Soteroâs property was a straight path and to allow a detour by cutting through Anastaciaâs property would no longer make the path straight. Hence the trial court concluded that it was more practical to extend the existing pathway to the public road by removing that portion of the store blocking the path as that was the shortest route to the public road and the least prejudicial to the parties concerned than passing through Anastaciaâs property.
[5]
On appeal by respondent Yolanda, the Court of Appeals reversed the lower court and held that she was entitled to a right of way on petitionerâs property and that the way proposed by Yolanda would cause the least damage and detriment to the servient estate.
[6]
The appellate court however did not award damages to private respondent as petitioner did not act in bad faith in resisting the claim.
Petitioner now comes to us imputing ERROR to respondent Court of Appeals: (a) in disregarding the agreement of the parties; (b) in considering petitionerâs property as a servient estate despite the fact that it does not abut or adjoin the property of private respondent; and, (c) in holding that the one-meter by five-meter passage way proposed by private respondent is the least prejudicial and the shortest distance to the public road.
Incidentally, petitioner denies having promised private respondent a right of way. She claims that her agreement with private respondent was to provide the latter with a right of way on the other lot of Antonio Quimen under her administration when it was not yet sold to private respondent. Petitioner insists that passing through the property of Yolandaâs parents is more accessible to the public road than to make a detour to her property and cut down the avocado tree standing thereon.
Petitioner further argues that when Yolanda purchased Lot No. 1448-B-6-B in 1986 the easement of right of way she provided her (petitioner) was
ipso jure
extinguished as a result of the merger of ownership of the dominant and the servient estates in one person so that there was no longer any compelling reason to provide private respondent with a right of way as there are other surrounding lots suitable for the purpose. Petitioner strongly maintains that the proposed right of way is not the shortest access to the public road because of the detour and that, moreover, she is likely to suffer the most damage as she derives a net income of P600.00 per year from the sale of the fruits of her avocado tree, and considering that an avocado has an average life span of seventy (70) years, she expects a substantial earning from it.
[7]
But we find no cogent reason to disturb the ruling of respondent appellate court granting a right of way to private respondent through petitionerâs property. In fact, as between petitioner Anastacia and respondent Yolanda their agreement has already been rendered moot insofar as it concerns the determination of the principal issue herein presented. The voluntary easement in favor of private respondent, which petitioner now denies but which the court is inclined to believe, has in fact become a legal easement or an easement by necessity constituted by law.
[8]
As defined, an easement is a real right on anotherâs property, corporeal and immovable, whereby the owner of the latter must refrain from doing or allowing somebody else to do or something to be done on his property, for the benefit of another person or tenement.
[9]
It is
jus in re aliena,
inseparable, indivisible and perpetual, unless extinguished by causes provided by law. A right of way in particular is a privilege constituted by covenant or granted by law
[10]
to a person or class of persons to pass over anotherâs property when his tenement is surrounded by realties belonging to others without an adequate outlet to the public highway. The owner of the dominant estate can demand a right of way through the servient estate provided he indemnifies the owner thereof for the beneficial use of his property.
[11]
The conditions
sine qua non
for a valid grant of an easement of right of way are: (a) the dominant estate is surrounded by other immovables without an adequate outlet to a public highway; (b) the dominant estate is willing to pay the proper indemnity; (c) the isolation was not due to the acts of the dominant estate; and, (d) the right of way being claimed is at a point least prejudicial to the servient estate.
[12]
A cursory examination of the complaint of respondent Yolanda for a right of way
[13]
readily shows that-
[E]ven before the purchase of the said parcels of land the plaintiff was reluctant to purchase the same for they are enclosed with permanent improvements like a concrete fence and store and have (sic) no egress leading to the road but because of the assurance of the defendant that plaintiff will be provided one (1) meter wide and five (5) meters long right of way in the sum of P200.00 per square meter to be taken from Anastaciaâs lot at the side of a concrete store until plaintiff reach(es) her fatherâs land, plaintiff was induced to buy the aforesaid parcels of land x x x. That the aforesaid right of way is the shortest, most convenient and the least onerous leading to the road and being used by the plaintiffâs predecessors-in-interest from the very inception x x x.
The evidence clearly shows that the property of private respondent is hemmed in by the estates of other persons including that of petitioner; that she offered to pay P200.00 per square meter for her right of way as agreed between her and petitioner; that she did not cause the isolation of her property; that the right of way is the least prejudicial to the servient estate.
[14]
These facts are confirmed in the ocular inspection report of the clerk of court, more so that the trial court itself declared that
""[t]he said properties of Antonio Quimen which were purchased by plaintiff Yolanda Quimen Oliveros were totally isolated from the public highway and there appears an imperative need for an easement of right of way to the public highway.""
[15]
Petitioner finally insists that respondent court erroneously concluded that the right of way proposed by private respondent is the least onerous to the parties. We cannot agree. Article 650 of the New Civil Code explicitly states that the easement of right of way shall be established at the point least prejudicial to the servient estate and, insofar as consistent with this rule, where the distance from the dominant estate to a public highway may be the shortest. The criterion of
least prejudice
to the servient estate must prevail over the criterion of
shortest distance
although this is a matter ofjudicial appreciation. While shortest distance may ordinarily imply
least prejudice,
it is not always so as when there are permanent structures obstructing the
shortest distance
; while on the other hand, the
longest distance
may be free of obstructions and the easiest or most convenient to pass through. In other words, where the easement may be established on any of several tenements surrounding the dominant estate, the one where the way is
shortest
and will cause the
least damage
should be chosen. However, as elsewhere stated, if these two (2) circumstances do not concur in a single tenement, the way which will cause the least damage should be used, even if it will not be the shortest.
[16]
This is the test.
In the trial court, petitioner openly admitted -
Q. You testified during your direct examination about this plan, kindly go over this and please point to us in what portion of this plan is the house or store of the father of the (plaintiff)?
A. This one, sir (witness pointed a certain portion located near the proposed right of way).
xxx
Q.    Now, you will agree with me x x x that this portion is the front portion of the lot owned by the father of the plaintiff and which was (sic) occupied by a store made up of strong materials?
A.    It is not true, sir.
Q.    What materials does (sic) this store of the father of the plaintiff made of?
A.    Hollow blocks and the side is made of wood, sir.
xxx
Q. Just before your brother disposed that 1/2 portion of the lot in question, what right of way does (sic) he use in reaching the public road, kindly point to this sketch that he is (sic) using in reaching the public road?
A. In my property, sir.
Q. Now you will agree with me x x x the main reason why your brother is (sic) using this property is because there was a store located near this portion?
A. Yes, and according to the father of Yolanda there is no other way than this, sir.
[17]
The trial court found that Yolandaâs property was situated at the back of her fatherâs property and held that there existed an available space of about nineteen (19) meters long which could conveniently serve as a right of way between the boundary line and the house of Yolandaâ s father; that the vacant space ended at the left back of Soteroâs store which was made of strong materials; that this explained why Yolanda requested a detour to the lot of Anastacia and cut an opening of one (1) meter wide and five (5) meters long to serve as her right of way to the public highway. But notwithstanding its factual observations, the trial court concluded, although erroneously, that Yolanda was not entitled to a right of way on petitionerâs property since a detour through it would not make the line straight and would not be the route shortest to the public highway.
In applying Art. 650 of the New Civil Code, respondent Court of Appeals declared that the proposed right of way of Yolanda, which is one (1) meter wide and five (5) meters long at the extreme right of petitionerâs property, will cause the least prejudice and/or damage as compared to the suggested passage through the property of Yolandaâ s father which would mean destroying the sari-sari store made of strong materials. Absent any showing that these findings and conclusion are devoid of factual support in the records, or are so glaringly erroneous, this Court accepts and adopts them. As between a right of way that would demolish a store of strong materials to provide egress to a public highway, and another right of way which although longer will only require an avocado tree to be cut down, the second alternative should be preferred. After all, it is not the main function of this Court to analyze or weigh the evidence presented all over again where the petition would necessarily invite calibration of the whole evidence considering primarily the credibility of witnesses, existence and relevancy of specific surrounding circumstances, their relation to each other, and the probabilities of the situation.
[18]
In sum, this Court finds that the decision of respondent appellate court is thoroughly backed up by law and the evidence.
WHEREFORE,
no reversible error having been committed by respondent Court of Appeals, the petition is
DENIED
and the decision subject of review is
AFFIRMED.

THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. RENANTE PARAGUA AND EDGARDO PARAGUA, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.
D E C I S I O N
HERMOSISIMA, JR., J.:
This is an appeal from the decision
[1]
of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 55, Lucena City, the dispositive portion of which reads:
""WHEREFORE, the Court hereby finds the accused Renante and Edgardo, both surnamed Paragua guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principals of the crime of Murder qualified by treachery, as defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, and appreciating the mitigating circumstance of minority in favor of accused Edgardo Paragua only, and after applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, hereby sentence Edgardo Paragua to suffer an indeterminate penalty ranging from TWELVE YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of
reclusion temporal,
as minimum, to SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS and FOUR (4) MONTHS of
reclusion temporal,
as maximum, and Renante Paragua to suffer the penalty of
reclusion perpetua
both accused, jointly and severally, to indemnify the heirs of Dennis Baladad in the amount of P7,000.00 by way of actual damages, P30,000.00 by way of compensatory damages; and to pay the costs of this action proportionately.
SO ORDERED.""
The antecedent facts, as found by the trial court, are as follows:
[2]
""Bartolome Umila is a childmate of Dennis Baladad and the barriomate of the two (2) accused. On December 3, 1988, at about 8:30 oâclock in the evening more or less, he was at the house of Diosdado Sinag at Barangay Limbon, Sariaya, Quezon. With him were the latter, a certain Nelson, Isidro Camu, Raul Ilao and Leody Leonor. He was seated with Dennis Baladad while the others were making âNilupak.â The accused Renante and Edgardo Paragua were also seated in the same row where he and Dennis Baladad were seated. Seeing Renante Paragua making a cross, Bartolome Umila asked for whom the cross was and Renante Paragua answered that the cross was for him (Bartolome Umila) and Dennis Baladad. Bartolome Umila and Dennis Baladad did not do anything after Renante Paragua made such answer, and after about six (6) minutes, both accused left the place of Diosdado Sinag.
After the lapse of ten (10) minutes, Bartolome Umila and Dennis Baladad likewise left the same place and proceeded towards the house of Dennis Baladad. However, while Bartolome Umila was walking ahead of Dennis Baladad, he suddenly heard the latter uttered the following: âInay ko po,â and when he turned a flashlight towards his back, he saw Dennis Baladad being stabbed by the two (2) accused with a âgulukan.â He saw further that Edgardo Paragua held Danilo Baladad with his left hand and stabbed the latter with his right hand. While the other accused, Renante Paragua, also stabbed Dennis Baladad.
Bartolome Umila then tried to help Dennis Baladad but when he tried to approach him, Renante Paragua lunged at him. To avoid getting stabbed, he ran away from the scene towards their house where, upon arrival and after gaining his composure, he told his parents about the incident. His parents accompanied him back to the place of the incident but they found Dennis Baladad already dead thereat. Bartolome Umila subsequently proceeded to the house of Dennis Baladad and informed the people thereat about the stabbing incident.""
The appellants argued that the trial court erred in:
[3]
1) holding that accused-appellants killed the deceased Dennis Baladad.
2) holding them guilty of the crime of murder.
It is appellantsâ contention that the trial court convicted them only on the basis of the lone testimony of the eyewitness, Bartolome Umila, notwithstanding the fact that Umilaâs testimony is not worthy of belief because it is unlikely for a person who had witnessed a murder to run to his parentsâ house without even informing the victimâs parents first, since the victimâs parents ought to be more interested in giving aid to the victim. Furthermore, appellants alleged that no motive has been established for the killing.
[4]
Also claimed is that the testimony of Umila raises doubt as to the identity of the killers because he said that the report made by Teodoro Baladad which was entered in the police blotter made manifest the fact that the suspects were unknown (Exhibit 1). Consequently, the trial court allegedly committed an error in finding them culpable for the death of the victim.
We find the appeal to be without merit.
In the absence of evidence to show any reason or motive why witnesses for the prosecution testified falsely, the logical conclusion is that no improper motive existed and that their testimony is worthy of full faith and credit.
[5]
The defense of the accused is hinged on alibi and denial, which warrant the least credibility or none at all. Both accused testified that they were already home when the stabbing incident happened, Edgardo had come from a ""lupakan ng saging,""
[6]
while Renante had come from the ricefield.
[7]
Both allegedly arrived home at around nine oâclock in the evening. To corroborate these defenses, their respective fathers, Rodolfo and Gerardo, (both surnamed Paragua), testified as to the time of their arrival at their respective houses,
[8]
with Rodolfoâ s admission that he did not know the whereabouts of his son, Edgardo, the whole day of December 3, 1988.
[9]
As can easily be perceived, these testimonies are self-serving and, consistent with the rule on criminal cases, alibi and denial are unavailing as defenses.
Between the self-serving testimonies of accused-appellants and their positive identification by an eye-witness, the latter deserves greater credence.
[10]
Denial, if unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is a negative and self-serving evidence which deserves no weight in law and cannot be given greater evidentiary value over the testimony of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters.
[11]
The defenseâs attack on the credibility of the lone eyewitness, Bartolome Umila, simply because the latter admitted having run to his parentsâ house after the incident instead of going to the house of the victimâs parents is of little or of no significance at all.
As we have held in the case of
People v. Arnan,
[12]
there is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful experience. It is, however, a basic human instinct for any person who witnesses a criminal act to run for his life when threatened by the perpetrators. In this case, the eyewitness had to be wary because appellants perceived that he had witnessed their dastardly act and had positively identified the killers.
The findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses are entitled to the highest degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of any showing that said court overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance.
[13]
The rule is well-settled that the prosecution need not prove motive on the part of the accused when the latter has been positively identified as the author of the crime.
[14]
And it is a matter of judicial knowledge that persons have been killed or assaulted for no apparent reason at all, and that friendship or even relationship is no deterrent to the commission of a crime.
[15]
Furthermore, appellants raise doubt as to their identification by pointing to the fact that, in the report made by the victimâs relative and the eyewitness Umila, they were not named as suspects and, hence, Umila could not have actually witnessed the killing. This Court has held Since time immemorial that entries in a police blotter, though regularly done in the course of the performance of official duty, are not conclusive proof of the truth of such entries
[16]
and should not be given undue significance or probative value for they are usually incomplete and inaccurate. Sometimes they are taken from either partial suggestion or inaccurate reporting and hearsay, untested in the crucible of a trial on the merits. The trial court did not err in convicting the accused-appellants of the crime of murder qualified by treachery.
Under the Revised Penal Code, murder is defined in this manner:
""Art. 248.
Murder.
- Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246, shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by reclusion temporal in its maximum period to death, if committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:
1. With treachery, taking advantage of superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense, or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity.""
[17]
xxx                 xxx                  xxx
Circumstances surrounding the killing of the victim Dennis Baladad clearly indicate the presence of alevosia or treachery which qualified the crime committed into murder. The Municipal Health Officer of Sariaya, Quezon, Mr. Flaviano Maligaya, who conducted the post-mortem examination on the body of the victim testified that the latter sustained thirty six (36) stab wounds both at the back and in front of his body.
[18]
This number of stab wounds inflicted on the victim is a strong indication that appellants made sure of the success of their effort to kill the victim without risk to themselves. Treachery attended the crime and qualified it to murder because the killing was perpetrated during nighttime and the victim was completely taken by surprise when the appellants attacked him and was rendered unable to defend himself when appellants held his arms and stabbed him.
In view of the foregoing, the Decision of the Trial Court finding the accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder is hereby
AFFIRMED
in toto.
SO ORDERED.
